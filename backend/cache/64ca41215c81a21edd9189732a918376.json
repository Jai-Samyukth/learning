BOWER∗\nCHAPTER I\nPEACEFUL HART RANCH\nIt was somewhere in the seventies when old Peaceful Hart woke to\na realization that gold-hunting and lumbago do not take kindly to\none another, and the fact that his pipe and dim-eyed meditation\nappealed to him more keenly than did his prospector’s pick and\nshovel and pan seemed to imply that he was growing old. He was a\nsilent man, by occupation and by nature, so he said nothing about\nit; but, like the wild things of prairie and wood, instinctively\nbegan preparing for the winter of his life. Where he had lately\nbeen washing tentatively the sand along Snake River, he built a\nranch. His prospector’s tools he used in digging ditches to\nirrigate his new-made meadows, and his mining days he lived over\nagain only in halting recital to his sons when they clamored for\ndetails of the old days when Indians were not mere untidy\nneighbors to be gossiped with and fed, but enemies to be fought,\nupon occasion.\nThey felt that fate had cheated them–did those ﬁve sons; for\nthey had been born a few years too late for the fun. Not one of\nthem would ever have earned the title of ”Peaceful,” as had his\nfather. Nature had played a joke upon old Peaceful Hart; for he,\nthe mildest-mannered man who ever helped to tame the West when it\nreally needed taming, had somehow fathered ﬁve riotous young\nmales to whom ﬁght meant fun–and the ﬁercer, the funnier.\nHe used to suck at his old, straight-stemmed pipe and regard them\nwith a bewildered curiosity sometimes; but he never tried to put\nhis puzzlement into speech. The nearest he ever came to\nelucidation, perhaps, was when he turned from them and let his\npale-blue eyes dwell speculatively upon the face of his wife,\nPhoebe. Clearly he considered that she was responsible for their\ndispositions.\n∗PDF created by pdfbooks.co.za\n1\nThe house stood cuddled against a rocky bluﬀ so high it dwarfed\nthe whole ranch to pygmy size when one gazed down from the rim,\nand so steep that one wondered how the huge, gray bowlders\nmanaged to perch upon its side instead of rolling down and\ncrushing the buildings to dust and fragments. Strangers used to\nkeep a wary eye upon that bluﬀ, as if they never felt quite safe\nfrom its menace. Coyotes skulked there, and tarantulas and\n”bobcats” and snakes. Once an outlaw hid there for days, within\nsight and hearing of the house, and stole bread from Phoebe’s\npantry at night–but that is a story in itself.\nA great spring gurgled out from under a huge bowlder just behind\nthe house, and over it Peaceful had built a stone milk house,\nwhere Phoebe spent long hours in cool retirement on churning day,\nand where one went to beg good things to eat and to drink. There\nwas fruit cake always hidden away in stone jars, and cheese, and\nbuttermilk, and cream.\nPeaceful Hart must have had a streak of poetry somewhere hidden\naway in his silent soul. He built a pond against the bluﬀ;\nhollowed it out from the sand he had once washed for traces of\ngold, and let the big spring ﬁll it full and seek an outlet at\nthe far end, where it slid away under a little stone bridge. He\nplanted the pond with rainbow trout, and on the margin a rampart\nof Lombardy poplars, which grew and grew until they threatened to\nreach up and tear ragged holes in the drifting clouds. Their\nslender shadows lay, like gigantic ﬁngers, far up the bluﬀ when\nthe sun sank low in the afternoon.\nBehind them grew a small jungle of trees-catalpa and locust among\nthem–a jungle which surrounded the house, and in summer hid it\nfrom sight entirely.\nWith the spring creek whispering through the grove and away to\nwhere it was deﬁled by trampling hoofs in the corrals and\npastures beyond, and with the roses which Phoebe Hart kept abloom\nuntil tho frosts came, and the bees, and humming–birds which\nsomehow found their way across the parched sagebrush plains and\nforegathered there, Peaceful Hart’s ranch betrayed his secret\nlonging for girls, as if he had unconsciously planned it for the\ndaughters he had been denied.\nIt was an ideal place for hammocks and romance–a place where\ndainty maidens might dream their way to womanhood. And Peaceful\nHart, when all was done, grew old watching ﬁve full-blooded boys\nclicking their heels unromantically together as they roosted upon\nthe porch, and threw cigarette stubs at the water lilies while\nthey wrangled amiably over the merits of their mounts; saw them\ndrag their blankets out into the broody dusk of the grove when\nthe nights were hot, and heard their muﬄed swearing under their\n2\n”tarps” because of the mosquitoes which kept the night air\ntwanging like a stricken harp string with their song.\nThey liked the place well enough. There were plenty of shady\nplaces to lie and smoke in when the mercury went sizzling up its\ntiny tube. Sometimes, when there was a dance, they would choose\nthe best of Phoebe’s roses to decorate their horses’ bridles; and\nperhaps their hatbands, also. Peaceful would then suck harder\nthan ever at his pipe, and his faded blue eyes would wander\npathetically about the little paradise of his making, as if he\nwondered whether, after all, it had been worth while.\nA tight picket fence, built in three unswerving lines from the\npost planted solidly in a cairn of rocks against a bowlder on the\neastern rim of the pond, to the road which cut straight through\nthe ranch, down that to the farthest tree of the grove, then back\nto the bluﬀ again, shut in that tribute to the sentimental side\nof Peaceful’s nature. Outside the fence dwelt sturdier, Western\nrealities.\nOnce the gate swung shut upon the grove one blinked in the garish\nsunlight of the plains. There began the real ranch world. There\nwas the pile of sagebrush fuel, all twisted and gray, pungent as\na bottle of spilled liniment, where braided, blanketed bucks were\nsometimes prevailed upon to labor desultorily with an ax in hope\nof being rewarded with fruit new-gathered from the orchard or a\nplace at Phoebe’s long table in the great kitchen.\nThere was the stone blacksmith shop, where the boys sweated over\nthe nice adjustment of shoes upon the feet of ﬁghting, wild-eyed\nhorses, which afterward would furnish a spectacle of unseemly\nbehavior under the saddle.\nFarther away were the long stable, the corrals where\nbroncho-taming was simply so much work to be performed,\nhayﬁelds, an orchard or two, then rocks and sand and sage which\ngrayed the earth to the very skyline.\nA glint of slithering green showed where the Snake hugged the\nbluﬀ a mile away, and a brown trail, ankle-deep in dust,\nstretched straight out to the west, and then lost itself\nunexpectedly behind a sharp, jutting point of rocks where the\nblufF had thrust out a rugged ﬁnger into the valley.\nBy devious turnings and breath-taking climbs, the trail ﬁnally\nreached the top at the only point for miles, where it was\npossible for a horseman to pass up or down.\nThen began the desert, a great stretch of unlovely sage and lava\nrock and sand for mile upon mile, to where the distant mountain\n3\nridges reached out and halted peremptorily the ugly sweep of it.\nThe railroad gashed it boldly, after the manner of the iron trail\nof modern industry; but the trails of the desert dwellers wound\nthrough it diﬃdently, avoiding the rough crest of lava rock\nwhere they might, dodging the most aggressive sagebrush and\ndipping tentatively into hollows, seeking always the easiest way\nto reach some remote settlement or ranch.\nOf the men who followed those trails, not one of them but could\nhave ridden straight to the Peaceful Hart ranch in black\ndarkness; and there were few, indeed, white men or Indians, who\ncould have ridden there at midnight and not been sure of blankets\nand a welcome to sweeten their sleep. Such was the Peaceful Hart\nRanch, conjured from the sage and the sand in the valley of the\nSnake.\nCHAPTER II\nGOOD INDIAN\nThere is a saying–and if it is not purely Western, it is at\nleast purely American–that the only good Indian is a dead\nIndian. In the very teeth of that, and in spite of tho fact that\nhe was neither very good, nor an Indian–nor in any sense\n”dead”– men called Grant Imsen ”Good Indian” to his face; and if\nhe resented the title, his resentment was never made\nmanifest–perhaps because he had grown up with the name, he\nrather liked it when he was a little fellow, and with custom had\ncome to take it as a matter of course.\nBecause his paternal ancestry went back, and back to no one knows\nwhere among the race of blue eyes and fair skin, the Indians\nrepudiated relationship with him, and called him white\nman–though they also spoke of him unthinkingly as ”Good Injun.”\nBecause old Wolfbelly himself would grudgingly admit under\npressure that the mother of Grant had been the half-caste\ndaughter of Wolfbelly’s sister, white men remembered the taint\nwhen they were angry, and called him Injun. And because he stood\nthus between the two races of men, his exact social status a\nsubject always open to argument, not even the fact that he was\nlooked upon by the Harts as one of the family, with his own bed\nalways ready for him in a corner of the big room set apart for\nthe boys, and with a certain place at the table which was called\nhis–not even his assured position there could keep him from\nsometimes feeling quite alone, and perhaps a triﬂe bitter over\n4\nhis loneliness.\nPhoebe Hart had mothered him from the time when his father had\nsickened and died in her house, leaving Grant there with twelve\nyears behind him, in his hands a dirty canvas bag of gold coin so\nheavy he could scarce lift it, which stood for the mining claim\nthe old man had just sold, and the command to invest every one of\nthe gold coins in schooling.\nOld John Imsen was steeped in knowledge of the open; nothing of\nthe great outdoors had ever slipped past him and remained\nmysterious. Put when he sold his last claim–others he had\nwhich promised little and so did not count–he had signed his\nname with an X. Another had written the word John before that X,\nand the word Imsen after; above, a word which he explained was\n”his,” and below the word ”mark.” John Imsen had stared down\nsuspiciously at the words, and he had not felt quite easy in his\nmind until the bag of gold coins was actually in his keeping.\nAlso, he had been ashamed of that X. It was a simple thing to\nmake with a pen, and yet he had only succeeded in making it look\nlike two crooked sticks thrown down carelessly, one upon the\nother. His face had gone darkly red with the shame of it, and he\nhad stood scowling down at the paper.\n”That boy uh mine’s goin’ to do better ’n that, by God!” he had\nsworn, and the words had sounded like a vow.\nWhen, two months after that, he had faced–incredulously, as is\nthe way with strong men–the fact that for him life was over,\nwith nothing left to him save an hour or so of labored breath and\na few muttered sentences, he did not forget that vow. He called\nPhoebe close to the bed, placed the bag of gold in Grant’s\ntrembling hands, and stared intently from one face to the other.\n”Mis’ Hart, he ain’t got–anybody–my folks–I lost track of ’em\nyears ago. You see to it–git some learnin’ in his head. When a\nman knows books–it’s–like bein’ heeled–good gun–plenty uh\nca’t’idges– in a ﬁght. When I got that gold–it was like\nﬁghtin’ with my bare hands–against a gatlin’ gun. They coulda\ncheated me–whole thing–on paper–I wouldn’t know–luck–just\nluck they didn’t. So you take it–and git the boy schoolin’.\nCosts money–I know that–git him all it’ll buy. Send him–\nwhere they keep–the best. Don’t yuh let up–n’er let\nhim–whilst they’s a dollar left. Put it all–into his\nhead–then he can’t lose it, and he can–make it earn more.\nAn’–I guess I needn’t ask yuh–be good to him. He ain’t got\nanybody–not a soul–Injuns don’t count. You see to it–don’t\nlet up till–it’s all gone.”\nPhoebe had taken him literally. And Grant, if he had little\n5\ntaste for the task, had learned books and other things not\nmentioned in the curriculums of the schools she sent him to–and\nwhen the bag was reported by Phoebe to be empty, he had returned\nwith inward relief to the desultory life of the Hart ranch and\nits immediate vicinity.\nHis father would probably have been amazed to see how little\ndiﬀerence that schooling made in the boy. The money had lasted\nlong enough to take him through a preparatory school and into the\nsecond year of a college; and the only result apparent was speech\na shade less slipshod than that of his fellows, and a vocabulary\nwhich permitted him to indulge in an amazing number of epithets\nand in colorful vituperation when the fancy seized him.\nHe rode, hot and thirsty and tired, from Sage Hill one day and\nfound Hartley empty of interest, hot as the trail he had just now\nleft thankfully behind him, and so absolutely sleepy that it\nseemed likely to sink into the sage-clothed earth under the\nweight of its own dullness. Even the whisky was so warm it\nburned like ﬁre, and the beer he tried left upon his outraged\npalate the unhappy memory of insipid warmth and great bitterness.\nHe plumped the heavy glass down upon the grimy counter in the\ndusty far corner of the little store and stared sourly at Pete\nHamilton, who was apathetically opening hatboxes for the\ninspection of an Indian in a red blanket and frowsy braids.\n”How much?” The braided one ﬁngered indecisively the broad brim\nof a gray sombrero.\n”Nine dollars.” Pete leaned heavily against the shelves behind\nhim and sighed with the weariness of mere living.\n”Huh! All same buy one good hoss.” The braided one dropped the\nhat, hitched his blanket over his shoulder in stoical disregard\nof the heat, and turned away.\nPete replaced the cover, seemed about to place the box upon the\nshelf behind him, and then evidently decided that it was not\nworth the eﬀort. He sighed again.\n”It is almighty hot,” he mumbled languidly. ”Want another drink,\nGood Injun?”\n”I do not. Hot toddy never did appeal to me, my friend. If you\nweren’t too lazy to give orders, Pete, you’d have cold beer for a\nday like this. You’d give Saunders something to do beside lie in\nthe shade and tell what kind of a man he used to be before his\nlungs went to the bad. Put him to work. Make him pack this\nstuﬀ down cellar where it isn’t two hundred in the shade. Why\n6\ndon’t you?”\n”We was going to get ice t’day, but they didn’t throw it oﬀ when\nthe train went through.”\n”That’s comforting–to a man with a thirst like the great Sahara.\nIce! Pete, do you know what I’d like to do to a man that mentions\nice after a drink like that?”\nPete neither knew nor wanted to know, and he told Grant so. ”If\nyou’re going down to the ranch,” he added, by way of changing the\nsubject, ”there’s some mail you might as well take along.”\n”Sure, I’m going–for a drink out of that spring, if nothing\nelse. You’ve lost a good customer to-day, Pete. I rode up here\nprepared to get sinfully jagged–and here I’ve got to go on a\nstill hunt for water with a chill to it–or maybe buttermilk.\nPete, do you know what I think of you and your joint?”\n”I told you I don’t wanta know. Some folks ain’t never\nsatisﬁed. A fellow that’s rode thirty or forty miles to get\nhere, on a day like this, had oughta be glad to get anything that\nlooks like beer.”\n”Is that so?” Grant walked purposefully down to the front of the\nstore, where Pete was fumbling behind the rampart of crude\npigeonholes which was the post-oﬃce. ”Let me inform you, then,\nthat–”\nThere was a swish of skirts upon the rough platform outside, and\na young woman entered with the manner of feeling perfectly at\nhome there. She was rather tall, rather strong and capable\nlooking, and she was bareheaded, and carried a door key suspended\nfrom a smooth-worn bit of wood.\n”Don’t get into a perspiration making up the mail, Pete,” she\nadvised calmly, quite ignoring both Grant and the Indian.\n”Fifteen is an hour late–as usual. Jockey Bates always seems to\nbe under the impression he’s an undertaker’s assistant, and is\nheaded for the graveyard when he takes ﬁfteen out. He’ll get\nthe can, ﬁrst he knows–and he’ll put in a month or two\nwondering why. I could make better time than he does myself.”\nBy then she was leaning with both elbows upon the counter beside\nthe post-oﬃce, bored beyond words with life as it must be\nlived–to judge from her tone and her attitude.\n”For Heaven’s sake, Pete,” she went on languidly, ”can’t you\nscare up a novel, or chocolates, or gum, or–ANYTHING to kill\ntime? I’d even enjoy chewing gum right now–it would give my\njaws something to think of, anyway.”\n7\nPete, grinning indulgently, came out of retirement behind the\npigeonholes, and looked inquiringly around the store.\n”I’ve got cards,” he suggested. ”What’s the matter with a game\nof solitary? I’ve known men to put in hull winters alone, up in\nthe mountains, jest eating and sleeping and playin’ solitary.”\nThe young woman made a grimace of disgust. ”I’ve come from three\nsolid hours of it. What I really do want is something to read.\nHaven’t you even got an almanac?”\n”Saunders is readin’ ’The Brokenhearted Bride’– you can have it\nsoon’s he’s through. He says it’s a peach.”\n”Fifteen is bringing up a bunch of magazines. I’ll have reading\nin plenty two hours from now; but my heavens above, those two\nhours!” She struck both ﬁsts despairingly upon the counter.\n”I’ve got gumdrops, and fancy mixed–”\n”Forget it, then. A ﬁve-pound box of chocolates is due–on\nﬁfteen.” She sighed heavily. ”I wish you weren’t so old, and\nhadn’t quite so many chins, Pete,” she complained. ”I’d inveigle\nyou into a ﬂirtation. You see how desperate I am for something\nto do!”\nPete smiled unhappily. He was sensitive about all those chins,\nand the general bulk which accompanied them.\n”Let me make you acquainted with my friend, Good In–er–Mr.\nImsen.” Pete considered that he was behaving with great\ndiscernment and tact. ”This is Miss Georgie Howard, the new\noperator.” He twinkled his little eyes at her maliciously.\n”Say, he ain’t got but one chin, and he’s only twenty-three years\nold.” He felt that the inference was too plain to be ignored.\nShe turned her head slowly and looked Grant over with an air of\ndisparagement, while she nodded negligently as an acknowledgment\nto the introduction. ”Pete thinks he’s awfully witty,” she\nremarked. ”It’s really pathetic.”\nPete bristled–as much as a fat man could bristle on so hot a\nday. ”Well, you said you wanted to ﬂirt, and so I took it for\ngranted you’d like–”\nGood Indian looked straight past the girl, and scowled at Pete.\n”Pete, you’re an idiot ordinarily, but when you try to be smart\nyou’re absolutely insuﬀerable. You’re mentally incapable of\n8\nrecognizing the line of demarcation between legitimate persiﬂage\nand objectionable familiarity. An ignoramus of your particular\nclass ought to conﬁne his repartee to unqualiﬁed aﬃrmation or\nthe negative monosyllable.” Whereupon he pulled his hat more\nﬁrmly upon his head, hunched his shoulders in disgust,\nremembered his manners, and bowed to Miss Georgie Howard, and\nstalked out, as straight of back as the Indian whose blanket he\nbrushed, and who may have been, for all he knew, a blood relative\nof his.\n”I guess that ought to hold you for a while, Pete,” Miss Georgie\napproved under her breath, and stared after Grant curiously.\n”’You’re mentally incapable of recognizing the line of\ndemarcation between legitimate persiﬂage and objectionable\nfamiliarity.’ I’ll bet two bits you don’t know what that means,\nPete; but it hits you oﬀ exactly. Who is this Mr. Imsen?”\nShe got no reply to that. Indeed, she did not wait for a reply.\nOutside, things were happening–and, since Miss Georgie was dying\nof dullness, she hailed the disturbance as a Heaven-sent\nblessing, and ran to see what was going on.\nBrieﬂy, Grant had inadvertently stepped on a sleeping dog’s\npaw–a dog of the mongrel breed which infests Indian camps, and\nwhich had attached itself to the blanketed buck inside. The dog\nawoke with a yelp, saw that it was a stranger who had perpetrated\nthe outrage, and straightway fastened its teeth in the leg of\nGrant’s trousers. Grant kicked it loose, and when it came at him\nagain, he swore vengeance and mounted his horse in haste.\nHe did not say a word. He even smiled while he uncoiled his\nrope, widened the loop, and, while the dog was circling warily\nand watching for another chance at him, dropped the loop neatly\nover its front quarters, and drew it tight.\nSaunders, a weak-lunged, bandy-legged individual, who was\noﬃcially a general chore man for Pete, but who did little\nexcept lie in the shade, reading novels or gossiping, awoke then,\nand, having a reputation for tender-heartedness, waved his arms\nand called aloud in the name of peace.\n”Turn him loose, I tell yuh! A helpless critter like that–you\noughta be ashamed–abusin’ dumb animals that can’t ﬁght back!”\n”Oh, can’t he?” Grant laughed grimly.\n”You turn that dog loose!” Saunders became vehement, and paid the\npenalty of a paroxysm of coughing.\n”You go to the devil. If you were an able-bodied man, I’d get\n9\nyou, too–just to have a pair of you. Yelping, snapping curs,\nboth of you.” He played the dog as a ﬁsherman plays a trout.\n”That dog, him Viney dog. Viney heap likum. You no killum, Good\nInjun.” The Indian, his arms folded in his blanket, stood upon\nthe porch watching calmly the fun. ”Viney all time heap mad, you\nkillum,” he added indiﬀerently.\n”Sure it isn’t old Hagar’s?”\n”No b’long-um Hagar–b’long-um Viney. Viney heap likum.”\nGrant hesitated, circling erratically with his victim close to\nthe steps. ”All right, no killum–teachum lesson, though. Viney\nheap bueno squaw–heap likum Viney. No likum dog, though. Dog\nall time come along me.” He glanced up, passed over the fact\nthat Miss Georgie Howard was watching him and clapping her hands\nenthusiastically at the spectacle, and settled an unfriendly\nstare upon Saunders.\n”You shut up your yowling. You’ll burst a blood vessel and go to\nheaven, ﬁrst thing you know. I’ve never contemplated hiring you\nas my guardian angel, you blatting buck sheep. Go oﬀ and lie\ndown somewhere.” He turned in the saddle and looked down at the\ndog, clawing and ﬁghting the rope which held him fast just back\nof the shoulder–blades. ”Come along, doggie–NICE doggie!” he\ngrinned, and touched his horse with the spurs. With one leap, it\nwas oﬀ at a sharp gallop, up over the hill and through the\nsagebrush to where he knew the Indian camp must be.\nOld Wolfbelly had but that morning brought his thirty or forty\nfollowers to camp in the hollow where was a spring of clear\nwater–the hollow which had for long been known locally as ”the\nIndian Camp,” because of Wolfbelly’s predilection for the spot.\nWithout warning save for the beat of hoofs in the sandy soil,\nGrant charged over the brow of the hill and into camp, scattering\ndogs, papooses, and squaws alike as he rode.\nShriLL clamor ﬁlled the sultry air. Sleeping bucks awoke,\nscowling at the uproar; and the horse of Good Indian, hating\nalways the smell and the litter of an Indian camp, pitched\nfuriously into the very wikiup of old Hagar, who hated the rider\nof old. In the ﬁrst breathing spell he loosed the dog, which\nskulked, limping, into the ﬁrst sheltered spot be found, and\nlaid him down to lick his outraged person and whimper to himself\nat the memory of his plight. Grant pulled his horse to a restive\nstand before a group of screeching squaws, and laughed outright\nat the panic of them.\n”Hello! Viney! I brought back your dog,” he drawled. ”He tried\n10\nto bite me–heap kay bueno dog. Mebbyso you killum. Me no\nhurtum–all time him Hartley, all time him try hard bite me.\nSleeping Turtle tell me him Viney dog. he likum Viney, me no\nkill Viney dog. You all time mebbyso eat that dog–sabe? No\nkeep–Kay bueno. All time try for bite. You cookum, no can\nbite. Sabe?”\nAUTHOR’S NOTE.–The Indians of southern Idaho spoke a somewhat\nmixed dialect. Bueno (wayno), their word for ’good,’ undoubtedly\nbeing taken from the Spanish language. I believe the word ”kay”\nto be Indian. It means ”no’, and thus the ”Kay bueno” so often\nused by them means literally ’no good,” and is a term of reproach\nOn the other hand, ”heap bueno” is ”very good,” their enthusiasm\nbeing manifested merely by drawing out the word ”heap.” In\nspeaking English they appear to have no other way of expressing,\nin a single phrase, their like or dislike of an object or person.\nWithout waiting to see whether Viney approved of his method of\ndisciplining her dog, or intended to take his advice regarding\nits disposal, he wheeled and started oﬀ in the direction of the\ntrail which led down the bluﬀ to the Hart ranch. When he\nreached the ﬁrst steep descent, however, he remembered that Pete\nhad spoken of some mail for the Harts, and turned back to get it.\nOnce more in Hartley, he found that the belated train was making\nup time, and would be there within an hour; and, since it carried\nmail from the West, it seemed hardly worthwhile to ride away\nbefore its arrival. Also, Pete intimated that there was a good\nchance of prevailing upon the dining-car conductor to throw oﬀ a\nchunk of ice. Grant, therefore, led his horse around into the\nshade, and made himself comfortable while he waited.\nCHAPTER III\nOLD WIVES TALES\nDown the winding trail of Snake River bluﬀ straggled a blanketed\nhalf dozen of old Wolfbelly’s tribe, the braves stalking moodily\nin front and kicking up a gray cloud of dust which enveloped the\nsquaws behind them but could not choke to silence their shrill\nchatter; for old Hagar was there, and Viney, and the incident of\nthe dog was fresh in their minds and tickling their tongues.\nThe Hart boys were assembled at the corral, halter-breaking a\nthree-year-old for the pure fun of it. Wally caught sight of the\napproaching blotch of color, and yelled a wordless greeting; him\n11\nhad old Hagar carried lovingly upon her broad shoulders with her\nown papoose when he was no longer than her arm; and she knew his\nvoice even at that distance, and grinned–grinned and hid her joy\nin a fold of her dingy red blanket.\n”Looks like old Wolfbelly’s back,” Clark observed needlessly.\n”Donny, if they don’t go to the house right away, you go and tell\nmum they’re here. Chances are the whole bunch’ll hang around\ntill supper.”\n”Say!” Gene giggled with fourteen-year-old irrepressibility.\n”Does anybody know where Vadnie is? If we could spring ’em on\nher and make her believe they’re on the warpath–say, I’ll gamble\nshe’d run clear to the Malad!”\n”I told her, cross my heart, this morning that the Injuns are\npeaceful now. I said Good Injun was the only one that’s\ndangerous–oh, I sure did throw a good stiﬀ load, all right!”\nClark grinned at the memory. ”I’ve got to see Grant ﬁrst, when\nhe gets back, and put him wise to the rep he’s got. Vad didn’t\nhardly swallow it. She said: ’Why, Cousin Clark! Aunt Phoebe\nsays he’s perfectly lovely!”’ Clark mimicked the girl’s voice\nwith relish.\n”Aw–there’s a lot of squaws tagging along behind!” Donny\ncomplained disgustedly from his post of observation on the fence.\n”They’ll go to the house ﬁrst thing to gabble–there’s old Hagar\nwaddling along like a duck. You can’t make that warpath business\nstick, Clark–not with all them squaws.”\n”Well, say, you sneak up and hide somewhere till yuh see if\nVadnie’s anywhere around. If they get settled down talking to\nmum, they’re good for an hour–she’s churning, Don–you hide in\nthe rocks by the milk-house till they get settled. And I’ll see\nif– Git! Pikeway, while they’re behind the stacks!”\nDonny climbed down and scurried through the sand to the house as\nif his very life depended upon reaching it unseen. The group of\nIndians came up, huddled at the corral, and peered through the\nstout rails.\n”How! How!” chorused the boys, and left the horse for a moment\nwhile they shook hands ceremoniously with the three bucks. Three\nIndians, Clark decided regretfully, would make a tame showing on\nthe warpath, however much they might lend themselves to the\nspirit of the joke. He did not quite know how he was going to\nmanage it, but he was hopeful still. It was unthinkable that\nreal live Indians should be permitted to come and go upon the\nranch without giving Evadna Ramsey, straight from New Jersey, the\nscare of her life.\n12\nThe three bucks, grunting monosyllabic greetings’ climbed, in all\nthe dignity of their blankets, to the top rail of the corral, and\nroosted there to watch the horse-breaking; and for the present\nClark held his peace.\nThe squaws hovered there for a moment longer, peeping through the\nrails. Then Hagar–she of much ﬂesh and more temper–grunted a\nword or two, and they turned and plodded on to where the house\nstood hidden away in its nest of cool green. For a space they\nstood outside the fence, peering warily into the shade,\ninstinctively cautious in their manner of approaching a strange\nplace, and detained also by the Indian etiquette which demands\nthat one wait until invited to enter a strange camp.\nAfter a period of waiting which seemed to old Hagar suﬃcient,\nshe pulled her blanket tight across her broad hips, waddled to\nthe gate, pulled it open with self-conscious assurance, and led\nthe way soft-footedly around the house to where certain faint\nsounds betrayed the presence of Phoebe Hart in her stone milk-\nhouse.\nAt the top of the short ﬂight of wide stone steps they stopped\nand huddled silently, until the black shadow of them warned\nPhoebe of their presence. She had lived too long in the West to\nseem startled when she suddenly discovered herself watched by\nthree pair of beady black eyes, so she merely nodded, and laid\ndown her butter-ladle to shake hands all around.\n”How, Hagar? How, Viney? How, Lucy? Heap glad to see you.\nBueno buttermilk–mebbyso you drinkum?”\nHowever diﬃdent they might be when it came to announcing their\narrival, their bashfulness did not extend to accepting oﬀers of\nfood or drink. Three brown hands were eagerly\noutstretched–though it was the hand of Hagar which grasped ﬁrst\nthe big tin cup. They not only drank, they guzzled, and\nafterward drew a fold of blanket across their milk-white lips,\nand grinned in pure animal satisfaction.\n”Bueno. He-e-ap bueno!” they chorused appreciatively, and\nsquatted at the top of the stone steps, watching Phoebe\nmanipulate the great ball of yellow butter in its wooden bowl.\nAfter a brief silence, Hagar shook the tangle of unkempt, black\nhair away from her moonlike face, and began talking in a soft\nmonotone, her voice now and then rising to a shrill singsong.\n”Mebbyso Tom, mebbyso Sharlie, mebbyso Sleeping Turtle all time\ncome along,” she announced. ”Stop all time corral, talk yo’\n13\nboys. Mebbyso heap likum drink yo’ butter water. Bueno.”\nWhen Phoebe nodded assent, Hagar went on to the news which had\nbrought her so soon to the ranch–the news which satisﬁed both\nan old grudge and her love of gossip.\n”Good Injun, him all time heap kay bueno,” she stated\nemphatically, her sloe black eyes ﬁxed unwaveringly upon\nPhoebe’s face to see if the stab was eﬀective. ”Good Injun come\nHartley, all time drunk likum pig.\n”All time heap yell, heap shoot–kay bueno. Wantum ﬁght\nMan-that-coughs. Come all time camp, heap yell, heap shoot some\nmore. I fetchum dog–Viney dog–heap dragum through\nsagebrush–dog all time cry, no can get away–me thinkum kill\nthat dog. Squaws cry–Viney cry–Good Injun”–Hagar paused here\nfor greater eﬀect–”makum horse all time buck–ridum in\nwikiup–Hagar wikiup–all time breakum–no can ﬁx that wikiup.\nGood Injun, hee-e-ap kay bueno!” At the last her voice was high\nand tremulous with anger.\n”Good Indian mebbyso all same my boy Wally.” Phoebe gave the\nbutter a vicious slap. ”Me heap love Good Indian. You no call\nGood Indian, you call Grant. Grant bueno. Heap bueno all time.\nNo drunk, no yell, no shoot, mebbyso”–she hesitated, knowing\nwell the possibilities of her foster son–”mebbyso catchum\ndog–me think no catchum. Grant all same my boy. All time me\nlikum–heap bueno.”\nViney and Lucy nudged each other and tittered into their\nblankets, for the argument was an old one between Hagar and\nPhoebe, though the grievance of Hagar might be fresh. Hagar\nshifted her blanket and thrust out a stubborn under lip.\n”Wally boy, heap bueno,” she said; and her malicious old face\nsoftened as she spoke of him, dear as her own ﬁrst-born. ”Jack\nbueno, mebbyso Gene bueno, mebbyso Clark, mebbyso Donny all time\nbueno.” Doubt was in her voice when she praised those last two,\nhowever, because of their continual teasing. She stopped short\nto emphasize the damning contrast. ”Good Injun all same mebbyso\nyo’ boy Grant, hee-ee-eap kay bueno. Good Injun Grant all time\nDEBBIL!”\nIt was at this point that Donny slipped away to report that\n”Mamma and old Hagar are scrappin’ over Good Injun again,” and\ntold with glee the tale of his misdeeds as recounted by the\nsquaw.\nPhoebe in her earnestness forgot to keep within the limitations\nof their dialect.\n14\n”Grant’s a good boy, and a smart boy. There isn’t a\nbetter-hearted fellow in the country, if I have got ﬁve boys of\nmy own. You think I like him better than I like Wally, is all\nails you, Hagar. You’re jealous of Grant, and you always have\nbeen, ever since his father left him with me. I hope my heart’s\nbig enough to hold them all.” She remembered then that they\ncould not understand half she was saying, and appealed to Viney.\nViney liked Grant.\n”Viney, you tell me. Grant no come Hartley, no drunk, no yell,\nno catchum you dog, no ride in Hagar’s wikiup? You tell me,\nViney.”\nViney and Lucy bobbed their heads rapidly up and down. Viney,\nwith a sidelong glance at Hagar, spoke softly.\n”Good Injun Grant, mebbyso home Hartley,” she admitted\nreluctantly, as if she would have been pleased to prove Hagar a\nliar in all things. ”Me thinkum no drunk. Mebbyso ketchum\ndog–dog kay bueno, mebbyso me killing. Good Injun Grant no heap\nyell, no shoot all time–mebbyso no drunk. No breakum wikiup.\nHorse all time kay bueno, Hagar–”\n”Shont-isham!” (big lie) Hagar interrupted shrilly then, and\nViney relapsed into silence, her thin face growing sullen under\nthe upbraiding she received in her native tongue. Phoebe,\nlooking at her attentively, despaired of getting any nearer the\ntruth from any of them.\nThere was a sudden check to Hagar’s shrewish clamor. The squaws\nstiﬀened to immobility and listened stolidly, their eyes alone\nbetraying the curiosity they felt. Oﬀ somewhere at the head of\nthe tiny pond, hidden away in the jungle of green, a voice was\nsinging; a girl’s voice, and a strange voice–for the squaws knew\nwell the few women voices along the Snake.\n”That my girl,” Phoebe explained, stopping the soft pat–pat of\nher butter-ladle.\n”Where ketchum yo’ girl?” Hagar forgot her petulance, and became\ncurious as any white woman.\n”Me ketchum ’way oﬀ, where sun come up. In time me have heap\nboys–mebbyso want girl all time. My mother’s sister’s boy have\none girl, ’way oﬀ where sun come up. My mother’s sister’s boy\ndie, his wife all same die, that girl mebbyso heap sad; no got\nfather, no got mother–all time got nobody. Kay bueno. That\ngirl send one letter, say all time got nobody. Me want one girl.\nMe send one letter, tell that girl come, be all time my girl.\n15\nFive days ago, that girl come. Her heap glad; boys all time heap\nglad, my man heap glad. Bueno. Mebbyso you glad me have one\ngirl.” Not that their approval was necessary, or even of much\nimportance; but Phoebe was accustomed to treat them like spoiled\nchildren.\nHagar’s lip was out-thrust again. ”Yo’ ketchum one girl, mebbyso\nyo’ no more likum my boy Wally. Kay bueno.”\n”Heap like all my boys jus’ same,” Phoebe hastened to assure her,\nand added with a hint of malice, ”Heap like my boy Grant all\nsame.”\n”Huh!” Hagar chose to remain unconvinced and antagonistic. ”Good\nInjun kay bueno. Yo’ girl, mebbyso kay bueno.”\n”What name yo’ girl?” Viney interposed hastily.\n”Name Evadna Ramsey.” In spite of herself, Phoebe felt a triﬂe\nchilled by their lack of enthusiasm. She went back to her\nbutter-making in digniﬁed silence.\nThe squaws blinked at her stolidly. Always they were inclined\ntoward suspicion of strangers, and perhaps to a measure of\njealousy as well. Not many whites received them with frank\nfriendship as did the Hart family, and they felt far more upon\nthe subject than they might put into words, even the words of\ntheir own language.\nMany of the white race looked upon them as beggars, which was bad\nenough, or as thieves, which was worse; and in a general way they\ncould not deny the truth of it. But they never stole from the\nHarts, and they never openly begged from the Harts. The friends\nof the Harts, however, must prove their friendship before they\ncould hope for better than an imperturbable neutrality. So they\nwould not pretend to be glad. Hagar was right–perhaps the girl\nwas no good. They would wait until they could pass judgment upon\nthis girl who had come to live in the wikiup of the Harts. Then\nLucy, she who longed always for children and had been denied by\nfate, stirred slightly, her nostrils aquiver.\n”Mebbyso bueno yo’ girl,’, she yielded, speaking softly.\n”Mebbyso see yo’ girl.”\nPhoebe’s face cleared, and she called, in mellow crescendo: ”Oh,\nVa-ad-NIEE?” Immediately the singing stopped.\n”Coming, Aunt Phoebe,” answered the voice.\nThe squaws wrapped themselves afresh in their blankets, passed\n16\nbrown palms smoothingly down their hair from the part in the\nmiddle, settled their braids upon their bosoms with true feminine\ninstinct, and waited. They heard her feet crunching softly in\nthe gravel that bordered the pond, but not a head turned that\nway; for all the sign of life they gave, the three might have\nbeen mere eﬃgies of women. They heard a faint scream when she\ncaught sight of them sitting there, and their faces settled into\nmore stolid indiﬀerence, adding a hint of antagonism even to the\nsoft eyes of Lucy, the tender, childless one.\n”Vadnie, here are some new neighbors I want you to get acquainted\nwith.” Phoebe’s eyes besought the girl to be calm. ”They’re all\nold friends of mine. Come here and let me introduce you–and\ndon’t look so horriﬁed, honey!”\nThose incorrigibles, her cousins, would have whooped with joy at\nher unmistakable terror when she held out a trembling hand and\ngasped faintly: ”H-how do you–do?”\n”This Hagar,” Phoebe announced cheerfully; and the old squaw\ncaught the girl’s hand and gripped it tightly for a moment in\nmalicious enjoyment of her too evident fear and repulsion.\n”This Viney.”\nViney, reading Evadna’s face in one keen, upward glance, kept her\nhands hidden in the folds of her blanket, and only nodded twice\nreassuringly.\n”This Lucy.”\nLucy read also the girl’s face; but she reached up, pressed her\nhand gently, and her glance was soft and friendly. So the ordeal\nwas over.\n”Bring some of that cake you baked to-day, honey–and do brace\nup!” Phoebe patted her upon the shoulder.\nHagar forestalled the hospitable intent by getting slowly upon\nher fat legs, shaking her hair out of her eyes, and grunting a\ncommand to the others. With visible reluctance Lucy and Viney\nrose also, hitched their blankets into place, and vanished,\nsoft-footed as they had come.\n”Oo-oo!” Evadna stared at the place where they were not. ”Wild\nIndians–I thought the boys were just teasing when they said\nso–and it’s really true, Aunt Phoebe?”\n”They’re no wilder than you are,” Phoebe retorted impatiently.\n17\n”Oh, they ARE wild. They’re exactly like in my history–and they\ndon’t make a sound when they go–you just look, and they’re gone!\nThat old fat one–did you see how she looked at me? As if she\nwanted to–SCALP me, Aunt Phoebe! She looked right at my hair\nand–”\n”Well, she didn’t take it with her, did she? Don’t be silly.\nI’ve known old Hagar ever since Wally was a baby. She took him\nright to her own wikiup and nursed him with her own papoose for\ntwo months when I was sick, and Viney stayed with me day and\nnight and pulled me through. Lucy I’ve known since she was a\npapoose. Great grief, child! Didn’t you hear me say they’re old\nfriends? I wanted you to be nice to them, because if they like\nyou there’s nothing they won’t do for you. If they don’t,\nthere’s nothing they WILL do. You might as well get used to\nthem–”\nOut by the gate rose a clamor which swept nearer and nearer until\nthe noise broke at the corner of the house like a great wave, in\na tumult of red blanket, ﬂying black hair, the squalling of a\nfemale voice, and the harsh laughter of the man who carried the\ndisturbance, kicking and clawing, in his arms. Fighting his way\nto the milk-house, he dragged the squaw along beside the porch,\nfollowed by the Indians and all the Hart boys, a yelling, jeering\naudience.\n”You tell her shont-isham! Ah-h–you can’t break loose, you old\nshe-wildcat. Quit your biting, will you? By all the big and\nlittle spirits of your tribe, you’ll wish–”\nPanting, laughing, swearing also in breathless exclamations, he\nforced her to the top of the steps, backed recklessly down them,\nand came to a stop in the corner by the door. Evadna had taken\nrefuge there; and he pressed her hard against the rough wall\nwithout in the least realizing that anything was behind him save\nunsentient stone.\n”Now, you sing your little song, and be quick about it!” he\ncommanded his captive sternly. ”You tell Mother Hart you lied.\nI hear she’s been telling you I’m drunk, Mother Hart–didn’t you,\nyou old beldam? You say you heap sorry you all time tellum lie.\nYou say: ’Good Injun, him all time heap bueno.’ Say: ’Good Injun\nno drunk, no heap shoot, no heap yell–all time bueno.’ Quick, or\nI’ll land you headforemost in that pond, you infernal old hag!”\n”Good Injun hee-eeap kay bueno! Heap debbil all time.” Hagar\nmight be short of breath, but her spirit was unconquered, and her\nunder lip bore witness to her stubbornness.\nPhoebe caught him by the arm then, thinking he meant to make good\n18\nhis threat–and it would not have been unlike Grant Imsen to do\nso.\n”Now, Grant, you let her go,” she coaxed. ”I know you aren’t\ndrunk–of course, I knew it all the time. I told Hagar so. What\ndo you care what she says about you? You don’t want to ﬁght an\nold woman, Grant–a man can’t ﬁght a woman–”\n”You tell her you heap big liar!” Grant did not even look at\nPhoebe, but his purpose seemed to waver in spite of himself.\n”You all time kay bueno. You all time lie.” He gripped her more\nﬁrmly, and turned his head slightly toward Phoebe. ”You’d be\ntired of it yourself if she threw it into you like she does into\nme, Mother Hart. It’s got so I can’t ride past this old hag in\nthe trail but she gives me the bad eye, and mumbles into her\nblanket. And if I look sidewise, she yowls all over the country\nthat I’m drunk. I’m getting tired of it!” He shook the squaw as\na puppy shakes a shoe–shook her till her hair quite hid her ugly\nold face from sight.\n”All right–Mother Hart she tellum mebbyso let you go. This time\nI no throw you in pond. You heap take care next time, mebbyso.\nYou no tellum big lie, me all time heap drunk. You kay bueno.\nAll time me tellum Mother Hart, tellum boys, tellum Viney, Lucy,\ntellum Charlie and Tom and Sleeping Turtle you heap big liar. Me\ntell Wally shont-isham. Him all time my friend–mebbyso him no\nlikum you no more.\n”Huh. Get out–pikeway before I forget you’re a lady!”\nHe laughed ironically, and pushed her from him so suddenly that\nshe sprawled upon the steps. The Indians grinned\nunsympathetically at her, for Hagar was not the most popular\nmember of the tribe by any means. Scrambling up, she shook her\nwitch locks from her face, wrapped herself in her dingy blanket,\nand scuttled away, muttering maledictions under her breath. The\nwatching group turned and followed her, and in a few seconds the\ngate was heard to slam shut behind them. Grant stood where he\nwas, leaning against the milk-house wall; and when they were\ngone, he gave a short, apologetic laugh.\n”No need to lecture, Mother Hart. I know it was a fool thing to\ndo; but when Donny told me what the old devil said, I was so mad\nfor a minute–”\nPhoebe caught him again by the arm and pulled him forward.\n”Grant! You’re squeezing Vadnie to death, just about! Great\ngrief, I forgot all about the poor child being here! You poor\nlittle–”\n19\n”Squeezing who?” Grant whirled, and caught a brief glimpse of a\ncrumpled little ﬁgure behind him, evidently too scared to cry,\nand yet not quite at the fainting point of terror. He backed,\nand began to stammer an apology; but she did not wait to hear a\nword of it. For an instant she stared into his face, and then,\nlike a rabbit released from its paralysis of dread, she darted\npast him and deaf up the stone steps into the house. He heard\nthe kitchen-door shut, and the click of the lock. He heard other\ndoors slam suggestively; and he laughed in spite of his\nastonishment.\n”And who the deuce might that be?” he asked, feeling in his\npocket for smoking material.\nPhoebe seemed undecided between tears and laughter. ”Oh, Grant,\nGRANT! She’ll think you’re ready to murder everybody on the\nranch–and you can be such a nice boy when you want to be! I did\nhope–”\n”I don’t want to be nice,” Grant objected, drawing a match along\na fairly smooth rock.\n”Well, I wanted you to appear at your best; and, instead of that,\nhere you come, squabbling with old Hagar like–”\n”Yes–sure. But who is the timid lady?”\n”Timid! You nearly killed the poor girl, besides scaring her half\nto death, and then you call her timid. I know she thought there\nwas going to be a real Indian massacre, right here, and she’d be\nscalped–”\nWally Hart came back, laughing to himself.\n”Say, you’ve sure cooked your goose with old Hagar, Grant! She’s\nright on the warpath, and then some. She’d like to burn yuh\nalive–she said so. She’s headed for camp, and all the rest of\nthe bunch at her heels. She won’t come here any more till you’re\nkicked oﬀ the ranch, as near as I could make out her jabbering.\nAnd she won’t do your washing any more, mum–she said so. You’re\nkay bueno yourself, because you take Good Indian’s part. We’re\nall kay bueno–all but me. She wanted me to quit the bunch and\ngo live in her wikiup. I’m the only decent one in the outﬁt.”\nHe gave his mother an aﬀectionate little hug as he went past,\nand began an investigative tour of the stone jars on the cool\nrock ﬂoor within. ”What was it all about, Grant? What did yuh\ndo to her, anyway?”\n”Oh, it wasn’t anything. Hand me up a cup of that buttermilk,\nwill you? They’ve got a dog up there in camp that I’m going to\n20\nkill some of these days–if they don’t beat me to it. He was up\nat the store, and when I went out to get my horse, he tried to\ntake a leg oﬀ me. I kicked him in the nose and he came at me\nagain, so when I mounted I just dropped my loop over Mr. Dog.\nSleeping Turtle was there, and he said the dog belonged to Viney,\nSo I just led him gently to camp.”\nHe grinned a little at the memory of his gentleness. ”I told\nViney I thought he’d make a ﬁne stew, and, they’d better use him\nup right away before he spoiled. That’s all there was to it.\nWell, Keno did sink his head and pitch around camp a little, but\nnot to amount to anything. He just stuck his nose into old\nHagar’s wikiup–and one sniﬀ seemed to be about all he wanted.\nHe didn’t hurt anything.”\nHe took a meditative bite of cake, ﬁnished the buttermilk in\nthree rapturous swallows, and bethought him of the feminine\nmystery.\n”If you please, Mother Hart, who was that Christmas angel I\nsquashed?”\n”Vad? Was Vad in on it, mum? I never saw her.” Wally\nstraightened up with a fresh chunk of cake in his hand. ”Was she\nscared?”\n”Yes,” his mother admitted reluctantly, ”I guess she was, all\nright. First the squaws–and, poor girl, I made her shake hands\nall round–and then Grant here, acting like a wild hyena–”\n”Say, PLEASE don’t tell me who she is, or where she belongs, or\nanything like that,” Grant interposed, with some sarcasm. ”I\nsmashed her ﬂat between me and the wall, and I scared the\ndaylights out of her; and I’m told I should have appeared at my\nbest. But who she is, or where she belongs–”\n”She belongs right here.” Phoebe’s tone was a challenge, whether\nshe meant it to be so or not. ”This is going to be her home from\nnow on; and I want you boys to treat her nicer than you’ve been\ndoing. She’s been here a week almost; and there ain’t one of you\nthat’s made friends with her yet, or tried to, even. You’ve\nplayed jokes on her, and told her things to scare her–and my\ngrief! I was hoping she’d have a softening inﬂuence on you, and\nmake gentlemen of you. And far as I can make out, just having\nher on the place seems to put the Old Harry into every one of\nyou! It isn’t right. It isn’t the way I expected my boys would\nact toward a stranger–a girl especially. And I did hope Grant\nwould behave better.”\n”Sure, he ought to. Us boneheads don’t know any better–but\n21\nGrant’s EDUCATED.” Wally grinned and winked elaborately at his\nmother’s back.\n”I’m not educated up to Christmas angels that look as if they’d\nbeen stepped on,” Grant defended himself.\n”She’s a real nice little thing. If you boys would quit teasing\nthe life out of her, I don’t doubt but what, in six months or so,\nyou wouldn’t know the girl,” Phoebe argued, with some heat.\n”I don’t know the girl now.” Grant spoke dryly. ”I don’t want\nto. If I’d held a tomahawk in one hand and her ﬂowing locks in\nthe other, and was just letting a war-whoop outa me, she’d look\nat me–the way she did look.” He snorted in contemptuous\namusement, and gave a little, writhing twist of his slim body\ninto his trousers. ”I never did like blondes,” he added, in a\ntone of ﬁnality, and started up the steps.\n”You never liked anything that wore skirts,” Phoebe ﬂung after\nhim indignantly; and she came very close to the truth.\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE CHRISTMAS ANGEL\nPhoebe watched the two unhappily, sighed when they disappeared\naround the corner of the house, and set her bowl of butter upon\nthe broad, ﬂat rock which just missed being overﬂowed with\nwater, and sighed again.\n”I’m afraid it isn’t going to work,” she murmured aloud; for\nPhoebe, having lived much of her life in the loneliness which the\nWest means to women, frequently talked to herself. ”She’s such a\nnice little thing–but the boys don’t take to her like I thought\nthey would. I don’t see as she’s having a mite of inﬂuence on\ntheir manners, unless it’s to make them act worse, just to shock\nher. Clark USED to take oﬀ his hat when he come into the house\nmost every time. And great grief! Now he’d wear it and his chaps\nand spurs to the table, if I didn’t make him take them oﬀ.\nShe’s nice–she’s most too nice. I’ve got to give that girl a\ngood talking to.”\nShe mounted the steps to the back porch, tried tho kitchen door,\nand found it locked. She went around to the door on the west\nside, opposite the gate, found that also secured upon the inside,\nand passed grimly to the next.\n22\n”My grief! I didn’t know any of these doors COULD be locked!” she\nmuttered angrily. ”They never have been before that I ever heard\nof.” She stopped before Evadna’s window, and saw, through a slit\nin the green blind, that the old-fashioned bureau had been pulled\nclose before it. ”My grief!” she whispered disgustedly, and\nretraced her steps to the east side, which, being next to the\npond, was more secluded. She surveyed dryly a window left wide\nopen there, gathered her brown-and-white calico dress close about\nher plump person, and crawled grimly through into the sitting-\nroom, where, to the distress of Phoebe’s order-loving soul, the\ncarpet was daily well-sanded with the tread of boys’ boots fresh\nfrom outdoors, and where cigarette stubs decorated every\nwindow-sill, and the stale odor of Peaceful’s pipe was never long\nabsent.\nShe went ﬁrst to all the outer rooms, and unlocked every one of\nthe outraged doors which, unless in the uproar and excitement of\nracing, laughing boys pursuing one another all over the place\nwith much slamming and good-natured threats of various sorts, had\nnever before barred the way of any man, be he red or white, came\nhe at noon or at midnight.\nEvadna’s door was barricaded, as Phoebe discovered when she\nturned the knob and attempted to walk in. She gave the door an\nindignant push, and heard a muﬄed shriek within, as if Evadna’s\nhead was buried under her pillow.\n”My grief! A body’d think you expected to be killed and eaten,”\nshe called out unsympathetically. ”You open this door! Vadnie\nRamsey. This is a nice way to act with my own boys, in my own\nhouse! A body’d think–”\nThere was the sound of something heavy being dragged laboriously\naway from tho barricaded door; and in a minute a vividly blue eye\nappeared at a narrow crack.\n”Oh, I don’t see how you dare to L-LIVE in such a place, Aunt\nPhoebe!” she cried tearfully, opening the door a bit wider.\n”Those Indians–and that awful man–”\n”That was only Grant, honey. Let me in. There’s a few things I\nwant to say to you, Vadnie. You promised to help me teach my\nboys to be gentle–it’s all they lack, and it takes gentle women,\nhoney–”\n”I am gentle,” Evadna protested grievedly. ”I’ve never once\nforgotten to be gentle and quiet, and I haven’t done a thing to\nthem–but they’re horrid and rough, anyway–”\n23\n”Let me in, honey, and we’ll talk it over. Something’s got to be\ndone. If you wouldn’t be so timid, and would make friends with\nthem, instead of looking at them as if you expected them to\nmurder you–I must say, Vadnie, you’re a real temptation; they\ncan’t help scaring you when you go around acting as if you\nexpected to be scared. You–you’re TOO–” The door opened still\nwider, and she went in. ”Now, the idea of a great girl like you\nhiding her head under a pillow just because Grant asked old Hagar\nto apologize!”\nEvadna sat down upon the edge of the bed and stared unwinkingly\nat her aunt. ”They don’t apologize like that in New Jersey,” she\nobserved, with some resentment in her voice, and dabbed at her\nunbelievably blue eyes with a moist ball of handkerchief.\n”I know they don’t, honey.” Phoebe patted her hand reassuringly.\n”That’s what I want you to help me teach my boys–to be real\ngentlemen. They’re pure gold, every one of them; but I can’t\ndeny they’re pretty rough on the outside sometimes. And I hope\nyou will be–”\n”Oh, I know. I understand perfectly. You just got me out here\nas a–a sort of sandpaper for your boys’ manners!” Evadna choked\nover a little sob of self-pity. ”I can just tell you one thing,\nAunt Phoebe, that fellow you call Grant ought to be smoothed with\none of those funny axes they hew logs with.”\nPhoebe bit her lips because she wanted to treat the subject very\nseriously. ”I want you to promise me, honey, that you will be\nparticularly nice to Grant; PARTICULARLY nice. He’s so alone,\nand he’s very proud and sensitive, because he feels his\nloneliness. No one understands him as I do–”\n”I hate him!” gritted Evadna, in an emphatic whisper which her\nAunt Phoebe thought it wise not to seem to hear.\nPhoebe settled herself comfortably for a long talk. The murmur\nof her voice as she explained and comforted and advised came\nsoothingly from the room, with now and then an interruption while\nshe waited for a tardy answer to some question. Finally she rose\nand stood in the doorway, looking back at a huddled ﬁgure on the\nbed.\n”Now dry your eyes and be a good girl, and remember what you’ve\npromised,” she admonished kindly. ”Aunt Phoebe didn’t mean to\nscold you, honey; she only wants you to feel that you belong\nhere, and she wants you to like her boys and have them like you.\nThey’ve always wanted a sister to pet; and Aunt Phoebe is hoping\nyou’ll not disappoint her. You’ll try; won’t you, Vadnie?”\n24\n”Y–yes,” murmured Vadnie meekly from the pillow. ”I know you\nwill.” Phoebe looked at her for a moment longer rather\nwistfully, and turned away. ”I do wish she had some spunk,” she\nmuttered complainingly, not thinking that Evadna might hear her.\n”She don’t take after the Ramseys none–there wasn’t anything\nmushy about them that I ever heard of.”\n”Mushy! MUSHY!” Evadna sat up and stared at nothing at all while\nshe repeated the word under her breath. ”She wants me to be\ngentle–she preached gentleness in her letters, and told how her\nboys need it, and then–she calls it being MUSHY!”\nShe reached mechanically for her hair-brush, and fumbled in a\ntumbled mass of shining, yellow hair quite as unbelievable in its\nway as were her eyes–Grant had shown a faculty for observing\nkeenly when he called her a Christmas angel–and drew out a half-\ndozen hairpins, letting them slide from her lap to the ﬂoor.\n”MUSHY!” she repeated, and shook down her hair so that it framed\nher face and those eyes of hers. ”I suppose that’s what they all\nsay behind my back. And how can a girl be nice WITHOUT being\nmushy?” She drew the brush meditatively through her hair. ”I am\nscared to death of Indians,” she admitted, with analytical\nfrankness, ”and tarantulas and snakes–but–MUSHY!”\nGrant stood smoking in the doorway of the sitting-room, where he\ncould look out upon the smooth waters of the pond darkening under\nthe shade of the poplars and the bluﬀ behind, when Evadna came\nout of her room. He glanced across at her, saw her hesitate, as\nif she were meditating a retreat, and gave his shoulders a twitch\nof tolerant amusement that she should be afraid of him. Then he\nstared out over the pond again. Evadna walked straight over to\nhim.\n”So you’re that other savage whose manners I’m supposed to\nsmooth, are you?” she asked abruptly, coming to a stop within\nthree feet of him, and regarding him carefully, her hands clasped\nbehind her.\n”Please don’t tease the animals,” Grant returned, in the same\nimpersonal tone which she had seen ﬁt to employ–but his eyes\nturned for a sidelong glance at her, although he appeared to be\nwatching the trout rise lazily to the insects skimming over the\nsurface of the water.\n”I’m supposed to be nice to you–par-TIC-ularly nice–because you\nneed it most. I dare say you do, judging from what I’ve seen of\nyou. At any rate, I’ve promised. But I just want you to\nunderstand that I’m not going to mean one single bit of it. I\ndon’t like you–I can’t endure you!–and if I’m nice, it will\njust be because I’ve promised Aunt Phoebe. You’re not to take my\n25\npoliteness at its face value, for back of it I shall dislike you\nall the time.”\nGrant’s lips twitched, and there was a covert twinkle in his\neyes, though he looked around him with elaborate surprise.\n”It’s early in the day for mosquitoes,” he drawled; ”but I was\nsure I heard one buzzing somewhere close.”\n”Aunt Phoebe ought to get a street roller to smooth your\nmanners,” Evadna observed pointedly.\n”Instead it’s as if she hung her picture of a Christmas angel up\nbefore the wolf’s den, eh?” he suggested calmly, betraying his\nIndian blood in the unconsciously symbolic form of expression.\n”No doubt the wolf’s nature will be greatly beneﬁted–his teeth\nwill be dulled for his prey, his voice softened for the\nnightcry–if he should ever, by chance, discover that the\nChristmas angel is there.”\n”I don’t think he’ll be long in making the discovery.” The blue\nof Evadna’s eyes darkened and darkened until they were almost\nblack. ”Christmas angel,–well, I like that! Much you know about\nangels.”\nGrant turned his head indolently and regarded her.\n”If it isn’t a Christmas angel–they’re always very blue and very\ngolden, and pinky-whitey–if it isn’t a Christmas angel, for the\nLord’s sake what is it?” He gave his head a slight shake, as if\nthe problem was beyond his solving, and ﬂicked the ashes from\nhis cigarette.\n”Oh, I could pinch you!” She gritted her teeth to prove she meant\nwhat she said.\n”It says it could pinch me.” Grant lazily addressed the trout.\n”I wonder why it didn’t, then, when it was being squashed?”\n”I just wish to goodness I had! Only I suppose Aunt Phoebe–”\n”I do believe it’s got a temper. I wonder, now, if it could be a\nLIVE angel?” Grant spoke to the softly swaying poplars.\n”Oh, you–there now!” She made a swift little rush at him, nipped\nhis biceps between a very small thumb and two ﬁngers, and stood\nback, breathing quickly and regarding him in a shamed deﬁance.\n”I’ll show you whether I’m alive!” she panted vindictively.\n26\n”It’s alive, and it’s a humming-bird. Angels don’t pinch.”\nGrant laid a ﬁnger upon his arm and drawled his solution of a\ntrivial mystery. ”It mistook me for a honeysuckle, and gave me a\npeck to make sure.” He smiled indulgently, and exhaled a long\nwreath of smoke from his nostrils. ”Dear little\nhumming-birds–so simple and so harmless!”\n”And I’ve promised to be nice to–THAT!” cried Evadna, in\nbitterness, and rushed past him to the porch.\nBeing a house built to shelter a family of boys, and steps being\na superﬂuity scorned by their agile legs, there was a sheer drop\nof three feet to the ground upon that side. Evadna made it in a\njump, just as the boys did, and landed lightly upon her slippered\nfeet.\n”I hate you–hate you–HATE YOU!” she cried, her eyes blazing up\nat his amused face before she ran oﬀ among the trees.\n”It sings a sweet little song,” he taunted, and his laughter\nfollowed her mockingly as she ﬂed from him into the shadows.\n”What’s the joke, Good Injun? Tell us, so we can laugh too.”\nWally and Jack hurried in from the kitchen and made for the\ndoorway where he stood.\nFrom under his straight, black brows Grant sent a keen glance\ninto the shade of the grove, where, an instant before, had\nﬂickered the white of Evadna’s dress. The shadows lay there\nquietly now, undisturbed by so much as a sleepy bird’s ﬂuttering\nwings.\n”I was just thinking of the way I yanked that dog down into old\nWolfbelly’s camp,” he said, though there was no tangible reason\nfor lying to them. ”Mister!” he added, his eyes still searching\nthe shadows out there in the grove, ”we certainly did go some!”\nCHAPTER V\n”I DON’T CARE MUCH ABOUT GIRLS”\n”There’s no use asking the Injuns to go on the warpath,” Gene\nannounced disgustedly, coming out upon the porch where the rest\nof the boys were foregathered, waiting for the ringing tattoo\nupon the iron triangle just outside the back door which would be\nthe supper summons. ”They’re too lazy to take the trouble–and,\n27\nbesides, they’re scared of dad. I was talking to Sleeping Turtle\njust now–met him down there past the Point o’ Rocks.”\n”What’s the matter with us boys going on the warpath ourselves?\nWe don’t need the Injuns. As long as she knows they’re hanging\naround close, it’s all the same. If we could just get mum oﬀ\nthe ranch–”\n”If we could kidnap her–say, I wonder if we couldn’t!” Clark\nlooked at the others tentatively.\n”Good Injun might do the rescue act and square himself with her\nfor what happened at the milk-house,” Wally suggested dryly.\n”Oh, say, you’d scare her to death. There’s no use in piling it\non quite so thick,” Jack interposed mildly. ”I kinda like the\nkid sometimes. Yesterday, when I took her part way up the bluﬀ,\nshe acted almost human. On the dead, she did!”\n”Kill the traitor! Down with him! Curses on the man who betrays\nus!” growled Wally, waving his cigarette threateningly.\nWhereupon Gene and Clark seized the oﬀender by heels and\nshoulders, and with a brief, panting struggle heaved him bodily\noﬀ the porch.\n”Over the cliﬀ he goes–so may all traitors perish!” Wally\ndeclaimed approvingly, drawing up his legs hastily out of the way\nof Jack’s clutching ﬁngers.\n”Say, old Peppajee’s down at the stable with papa,” Donny\ninformed them breathlessly. ”I told Marie to put him right next\nto Vadnie if he stays to supper–and, uh course, he will. If\nmamma don’t get next and change his place, it’ll be fun to watch\nher; watch Vad, I mean. She’s scared plum to death of anything\nthat wears a blanket, and to have one right at her elbow–wonder\nwhere she is–”\n”That girl’s got to be educated some if she’s going to live in\nthis family,” Wally observed meditatively. ”There’s a whole lot\nshe’s got to learn, and the only way to learn her thorough is–”\n”You forget,” Grant interrupted him ironically, ”that she’s going\nto make gentlemen of us all.”\n”Oh, yes–sure. Jack’s coming down with it already. You oughta\nbe quarantined, old-timer; that’s liable to be catching.” Wally\nsnorted his disdain of the whole proceeding. ”I’d rather go to\njail myself.”\n28\nEvadna by a circuitous route had reached the sitting-room without\nbeing seen or heard; and it was at this point in the conversation\nthat she tiptoed out again, her hands doubled into tight little\nﬁsts, and her teeth set hard together. She did not look, at\nthat moment, in the least degree ”mushy.”\nWhen the triangle clanged its supper call, however, she came\nslowly down from her favorite nook at the head of the pond, her\nhands ﬁlled with ﬂowers hastily gathered in the dusk.\n”Here she comes–let’s get to our places ﬁrst, so mamma can’t\nchange Peppajee around,” Donny implored, in a whisper; and the\ngroup on the porch disappeared with some haste into the kitchen.\nEvadna was leisurely in her movements that night. The tea had\nbeen poured and handed around the table by the Portuguese girl,\nMarie, and the sugar-bowl was going after, when she settled\nherself and her ruﬄes daintily between Grant and a braided,\ngreen-blanketed, digniﬁedly loquacious Indian.\nThe boys signaled each another to attention by kicking\nsurreptitiously under the table, but nothing happened. Evadna\nbowed a demure acknowledgment when her Aunt Phoebe introduced the\ntwo, accepted the sugar-bowl from Grant and the butter from\nPeppajee, and went composedly about the business of eating her\nsupper. She seemed perfectly at ease; too perfectly at ease,\ndecided Grant, who had an instinct for observation and was\ncovertly watching her. It was unnatural that she should rub\nelbows with Peppajee without betraying the faintest trace of\nsurprise that he should be sitting at the table with them.\n”Long time ago,” Peppajee was saying to Peaceful, taking up the\nconversation where Evadna had evidently interrupted it, ”many\nwinters ago, my people all time brave. A]1 time hunt, all time\nﬁght, all time heap strong. No drinkum whisky all same now.”\nHe ﬂipped a braid back over his shoulder, buttered generously a\nhot biscuit, and reached for the honey.” No brave no more–kay\nbueno. All time ketchum whisky, get drunk all same likum hog.\nHeap lazy. No hunt no more, no ﬁght. Lay all time in sun,\nsleep. No sun come, lay all time in wikiup. Agent, him givum\nﬂour, givum meat, givum blanket, you thinkum bueno. He tellum\nyou, kay bueno. Makum Injun lazy. Makum all same wachee-typo”\n(tramp). ”All time eat, all time sleep, playum cards all time,\ndrinkum whisky. Kay bueno. Huh.” The grunt stood for disgust\nof his tribe, always something of an aﬀectation with Peppajee.\n”My brother, my brother’s wife, my brother’s wife’s–ah–” He\nsearched his mind, frowning, for an English word, gave it up, and\nsubstituted a phrase. ”All the folks b’longum my brother’s wife,\nheap lazy all time. Me no likum. Agent one time givum plenty\n29\nﬂour, plenty meat, plenty tea. Huh. Them damn’ folks no eatum.\nAll time playum cards, drinkum whisky. All time otha fella\nketchum ﬂour, ketchum meat, ketchum tea–ketchum all them thing\nb’longum.” In the rhetorical pause he made there, his black eyes\nwandered inadvertently to Evadna’s face. And Evadna, the timid\none, actually smiled back.\n”Isn’t it a shame they should do that,” she murmured\nsympathetically.\n”Huh.” Peppajee turned his eyes and his attention to Peaceful,\nas if the opinion and the sympathy of a mere female were not\nworthy his notice. ”Them grub all gone, them Injuns mebbyso\nketchum hungry belly.” Evadna blushed, and looked studiously at\nher plate.\n”Come my wikiup. Me got plenty ﬂour, plenty meat, plenty tea.\nStay all time my wikiup. Sleepum my wikiup. Sun come up”–he\npointed a brown, sinewy hand toward the east–”eatum my grub.\nSun up there”–his ﬁnger indicated the zenith–”eatum some more.\nSun go ’way, eatum some more. Then sleepum all time my wikiup.\nBimeby, mebbyso my ﬂour all gone, my meat mebbyso gone, mebbyso\ntea–them folks all time eatum grub, me no ketchum. Me no playum\ncards, all same otha fella ketchum my grub. Kay bueno. Better\nme playum cards mebbyso all time.\n”Bimeby no ketchum mo’ grub, no stopum my wikiup. Them folks\npikeway. Me tellum ’Yo’ heap lazy, heap kay bueno. Yo’ all time\neatum my grub, yo’ no givum me money, no givum hoss, no givum\nnotting. Me damn’ mad all time yo’. Yo’ go damn’ quick!’”\nPeppajee held out his cup for more tea. ”Me tellum my brother,”\nhe ﬁnished sonorously, his black eyes sweeping lightly the faces\nof his audience, ”yo’ no come back, yo’–”\nEvadna caught her breath, as if someone had dashed cold water in\nher face. Never before in her life had she heard the epithet\nunprintable, and she stared ﬁxedly at the old-fashioned, silver\ncastor which always stood in the exact center of the table.\nOld Peaceful Hart cleared his throat, glanced furtively at\nPhoebe, and drew his hand down over his white beard. The boys\npuﬀed their cheeks with the laughter they would, if possible,\nrestrain, and eyed Evadna’s set face aslant. It was Good Indian\nwho rebuked the oﬀender.\n”Peppajee, mebbyso you no more say them words,” he said quietly.\n”Heap kay bueno. White man no tellum where white woman hear.\nWhite woman no likum hear; all time heap shame for her.”\n”Huh,” grunted Peppajee doubtingly, his eyes turning to Phoebe.\n30\nTimes before had he said them before Phoebe Hart, and she had\npassed them by with no rebuke. Grant read the glance, and\nanswered it.\n”Mother Hart live long time in this place,” he reminded him.\n”Hear bad talk many times. This girl no hear; no likum hear.\nYou sabe? You no make shame for this girl.” He glanced\nchallengingly across the table at Wally, whose grin was growing\nrather pronounced.\n”Huh. Mebbyso you boss all same this ranch?” Peppajee retorted\nsourly. ”Mebbyso Peacefu’ tellum, him no likum.”\nPeaceful, thus drawn into the discussion, cleared his throat\nagain.\n”Wel-l-l–WE don’t cuss much before the women,” he admitted\napologetically ”We kinda consider that men’s talk. I reckon\nVadnie’ll overlook it this time.” He looked across at her\nbeseechingly. ”You no feelum bad, Peppajee.”\n”Huh. Me no makum squaw-talk.” Peppajee laid down his knife,\nlifted a corner of his blanket, and drew it slowly across his\nstern mouth. He muttered a slighting sentence in Indian.\nIn the same tongue Grant answered him sharply, and after that was\nsilence broken only by the subdued table sounds. Evadna’s eyes\nﬁlled slowly until she ﬁnally pushed back her chair and hurried\nout into the yard and away from the dogged silence of that\nblanketed ﬁgure at her elbow.\nShe was scarcely settled, in the hammock, ready for a comforting\nhalf hour of tears, when someone came from the house, stood for a\nminute while he rolled a cigarette, and then came straight toward\nher.\nShe sat up, and waited defensively. More baiting, without a\ndoubt–and she was not in the mood to remember any promises about\nbeing a nice, gentle little thing. The ﬁgure came close,\nstooped, and took her by the arm. In the half–light she knew\nhim then. It was Grant.\n”Come over by the pond,” he said, in what was almost a command.”\nI want to talk to you a little.”\n”Does it occur to you that I might not want to talk t to you?”\nStill, she let him help her to her feet.\n”Surely. You needn’t open your lips if you don’t want to. Just\n’lend me your ears, and be silent that ye may hear.’ The boys\n31\nwill be boiling out on tho porch, as usual, in a minute; so\nhurry.”\n”I hope it’s something very important,” Evadna hinted\nungraciously.” Nothing else would excuse this high–handed\nproceeding.”\nWhen they had reached the great rock where the i pond had its\noutlet, and where was a rude seat hidden away in a clump of young\nwillows just across the bridge, he answered her.\n”I don’t know that it’s of any importance at all,” he said\ncalmly.” I got to feeling rather ashamed of myself, is all, and\nit seemed to me the only decent thing was to tell you so. I’m\nnot making any bid for your favor–I don’t know that I want it.\nI don’t care much about girls, one way or the other. But, for\nall I’ve got the name of being several things–a savage among the\nrest–I don’t like to feel such a brute as to make war on a girl\nthat seems to be getting it handed to her right along.”\nHe tardily lighted his cigarette and sat smoking beside her, the\ntiny glow lighting his face brieﬂy now and then.\n”When I was joshing you there before supper,” he went on,\nspeaking low that he might not be overheard–and ridiculed–from\nthe house, ”I didn’t know the whole outﬁt was making a practice\nof doing the same thing. I hadn’t heard about the dead tarantula\non your pillow, or the rattler coiled up on the porch, or any of\nthose innocent little jokes. But if the rest are making it their\nbusiness to devil the life out of you, why–common humanity\nforces me to apologize and tell you I’m out of it from now on.”\n”Oh! Thank you very much.” Evadna’s tone might be considered\nironical. ”I suppose I ought to say that your statement lessens\nmy dislike of you–”\n”Not at all.” Grant interrupted her. ”Go right ahead and hate\nme, if you feel that way. It won’t matter to me–girls never did\nconcern me much, one way or the other. I never was susceptible\nto beauty, and that seems to be a woman’s trump card, always–”\n”Well, upon my word!”\n”Sounds queer, does it? But it’s the truth, and so what’s the\nuse of lying, just to be polite? I won’t torment you any more;\nand if the boys rig up too strong a josh, I’m liable to give you\na hint beforehand. I’m willing to do that–my sympathies are\nalways with the under dog, anyway, and they’re ﬁve to one. But\nthat needn’t mean that I’m–that I–” He groped for words that\nwould not make his meaning too bald; not even Grant could quite\n32\nbring himself to warn a girl against believing him a victim of\nher fascinations.\n”You needn’t stutter. I’m not really stupid. You don’t like me\nany better than I like you. I can see that. We’re to be as\ndecent as possible to each other–you from ’common humanity,’ and\nI because I promised Aunt Phoebe.”\n”We-e-l!–that’s about it, I guess.” Grant eyed her sidelong.”\nOnly I wouldn’t go so far as to say I actually dislike you. I\nnever did dislike a girl, that I remember. I never thought\nenough about them, one way or the other.” He seemed rather fond\nof that statement, he repeated it so often.” The life I live\ndoesn’t call for girls. Put that’s neither here nor there. What\nI wanted to say was, that I won’t bother you any more. I\nwouldn’t have said a word to you tonight, if you hadn’t walked\nright up to me and started to dig into me. Of course, I had to\nﬁght back–tho man who won’t isn’t a normal human being.”\n”Oh, I know.” Evadna’s tone was resentful. ”From Adam down to\nyou, it has always been ’The woman, she tempted me.’ You’re\nperfectly horrid, even if you have apologized. ’The woman, she\ntempted me,’ and –”\n”I beg your pardon; the woman didn’t,” he corrected blandly.\n”The woman insisted on scrapping. That’s diﬀerent.”\n”Oh, it’s diﬀerent! I see. I have almost forgotten something I\nought to say, Mr. Imsen. I must thank you for–well, for\ndefending me to that Indian.”\n”I didn’t. Nobody was attacking you, so I couldn’t very well\ndefend you, could I? I had to take a fall out of old Peppajee,\njust on principle. I don’t get along very well with my noble red\ncousins. I wasn’t doing it on your account, in particular.”\n”Oh, I see.” She rose rather suddenly from the bench. ”It\nwasn’t even common humanity, then–”\n”Not even common humanity,” he echoed aﬃrmatively. ”Just a\nchance I couldn’t aﬀord to pass up, of digging into Peppajee.”\n”That’s diﬀerent.” She laughed shortly and left him, running\nswiftly through the warm dusk to the murmur of voices at the\nhouse.\nGrant sat where she left him, and smoked two cigarettes\nmeditatively before he thought of returning to the house. When\nhe ﬁnally did get upon his feet, he stretched his arms high\nabove his head, and stared for a moment up at the treetops\n33\nswaying languidly just under the stars.\n”Girls must play the very deuce with a man if he ever lets them\nget on his mind,” he mused. ”I see right now where a fellow\nabout my size and complexion had better watch out.” But he\nsmiled afterward, as if he did not consider the matter very\nserious, after all.\nCHAPTER VI\nTHE CHRISTMAS ANGEL PLAYS GHOST\nAt midnight, the Peaceful Hart ranch lay broodily quiet under its\nrock-rimmed bluﬀ. Down in tho stable the saddle-horses were but\nformless blots upon the rumpled bedding in their stalls–except\nHuckleberry, the friendly little pinto with the white eyelashes\nand the blue eyes, and the great, liver-colored patches upon his\nsides, and the appetite which demanded food at unseasonable\nhours, who was now munching and nosing industriously in the\ndepths of his manger, and making a good deal of noise about it.\nOutside, one of the milch cows drew a long, sighing breath of\ncontent with life, lifted a cud in mysterious, bovine manner, and\nchewed dreamily. Somewhere up the bluﬀ a bobcat squalled among\nthe rocks, and the moon, in its dissipated season of late rising,\nlifted itself indolently up to where it could peer down upon the\nsilent ranch.\nIn the grove where the tiny creek gurgled under the little stone\nbridge, someone was snoring rhythmically in his blankets, for\nthe boys had taken to sleeping in the open air before the\nearliest rose had opened buds in the sunny shelter of the porch.\nThree feet away, a sleeper stirred restlessly, lifted his head\nfrom the pillow, and slapped half-heartedly at an early mosquito\nthat was humming in his ear. He reached out, and jogged the\nshoulder of him who snored.\n”Say, Gene, if you’ve got to sleep at the top of your voice, you\nbetter drag your bed down into the orchard,” he growled. ”Let up\na little, can’t yuh?”\n”Ah, shut up and let a fellow sleep!” mumbled Gene, snuggling the\ncovers up to his ears.\n”Just what I want YOU to do. You snore like a sawmill. Darn it,\nyou’ve got to get out of the grove if yuh can’t–”\n34\n”Ah-h-EE-EE!” wailed a voice somewhere among the trees, the sound\nrising weirdly to a subdued crescendo, clinging there until one’s\nﬂesh went creepy, and then sliding mournfully down to silence.\n”What’s that?” The two jerked themselves to a sitting position,\nand stared into the blackness of the grove.\n”Bobcat,” whispered Clark, in a tone which convinced not even\nhimself.\n”In a pig’s ear,” ﬂouted Gene, under his breath. He leaned far\nover and poked his ﬁnger into a muﬄed form. ”D’yuh hear that\nnoise, Grant?”\nGrant sat up instantly. ”What’s tho matter?” he demanded, rather\nill-naturedly, if the truth be told.\n”Did you hear anything–a funny noise, like–”\nThe cry itself ﬁnished the sentence for him. It came from\nnowhere, it would seem, since they could see nothing; rose slowly\nto a subdued shriek, clung there nerve-wrackingly, and then\nwailed mournfully down to silence. Afterward, while their ears\nwere still strained to the sound, the bobcat squalled an answer\nfrom among the rocks.\n”Yes, I heard it,” said Grant. ”It’s a spook. It’s the wail of\na lost spirit, loosed temporarily from the horrors of purgatory.\nIt’s sent as a warning to repent you of your sins, and it’s\nhowling because it hates to go back. What you going to do about\nit?”\nHe made his own intention plain beyond any possibility of\nmisunderstanding. He lay down and pulled the blanket over his\nshoulders, cuddled his pillow under his head, and disposed\nhimself to sleep.\nThe moon climbed higher, and sent silvery splinters of light\nquivering down among the trees. A frog crawled out upon a great\nlily–pad and croaked dismally.\nAgain came the wailing cry, nearer than before, more subdued, and\nfor that reason more eerily mournful. Grant sat up, muttered to\nhimself, and hastily pulled on some clothes. The frog cut\nhimself short in the middle of a deep-throated ARR-RR-UMPH and\ndove headlong into the pond; and the splash of his body cleaving\nthe still surface of the water made Gene shiver nervously. Grant\nreached under his pillow for something, and freed himself\n35\nstealthily from a blanketfold.\n”If that spook don’t talk Indian when it’s at home, I’m very much\nmistaken,” he whispered to Clark, who was nearest. ”You boys\nstay here.”\nSince they had no intention of doing anything else, they obeyed\nhim implicitly and without argument, especially as a ﬂitting\nwhite ﬁgure appeared brieﬂy and indistinctly in a\nshadow-ﬂecked patch of moonlight. Crouching low in the shade of\na clump of bushes, Grant stole toward the spot.\nWhen he reached the place, the thing was not there. Instead, he\nglimpsed it farther on, and gave chase, taking what precautions\nhe could against betraying himself. Through the grove and the\ngate and across the road he followed, in doubt half the time\nwhether it was worth the trouble. Still, if it was what he\nsuspected, a lesson taught now would probably insure against\nfuture disturbances of the sort, he thought, and kept stubbornly\non. Once more he heard the dismal cry, and fancied it held a\nmocking note.\n”I’ll settle that mighty quick,” he promised grimly, as he jumped\na ditch and ran toward the place.\nSomewhere among the currant bushes was a sound of eery laughter.\nHe swerved toward the place, saw a white form rise suddenly from\nthe very ground, as it seemed, and lift an arm with a slow,\nbeckoning gesture. Without taking aim, he raised his gun and\nﬁred a shot at it. The arm dropped rather suddenly, and the\nwhite form vanished. He hurried up to where it had stood, knelt,\nand felt of the soft earth. Without a doubt there were\nfootprints there–he could feel them. But he hadn’t a match with\nhim, and the place was in deep shade.\nHe stood up and listened, thought he heard a faint sound farther\nalong, and ran. There was no use now in going quietly; what\ncounted most was speed.\nOnce more he caught sight of the white form ﬂeeing from him like\nthe very wraith it would have him believe it. Then he lost it\nagain; and when he reached the spot where it disappeared, he fell\nheadlong, his feet tangled in some white stuﬀ. He swore\naudibly, picked himself up, and held the cloth where the moon\nshone full upon it. It looked like a sheet, or something of the\nsort, and near one edge was a moist patch of red. He stared at\nit dismayed, crumpled the cloth into a compact bundle, tucked it\nunder his arm, and ran on, his ears strained to catch some sound\nto guide him.\n36\n”Well, anyhow, I didn’t kill him,” he muttered uneasily as he\ncrawled through a fence into the orchard. ”He’s making a pretty\nswift get-away for a fellow that’s been shot.”\nIn the orchard the patches of moonlight were larger, and across\none of them he glimpsed a dark object, running wearily. Grant\nrepressed an impulse to shout, and used the breath for an extra\nburst of speed. The ghost was making for the fence again, as if\nit would double upon its trail and reach some previously chosen\nrefuge. Grant turned and ran also toward the fence, guessing\nshrewdly that the fugitive would head for the place where the\nwire could be spread about, and a beaten trail led from there\nstraight out to the road which passed the house. It was the\nshort cut from the peach orchard; and it occurred to him that\nthis particular spook seemed perfectly familiar with the byways\nof the ranch. Near the fence he made a discovery that startled\nhim a little.\n”It’s a squaw, by Jove!” he cried when he caught an unmistakable\nﬂicker of skirts; and the next moment he could have laughed\naloud if he had not been winded from the chase. The ﬁgure\nreached the fence before him, and in the dim light he could see\nit stoop to pass through. Then it seemed as if the barbs had\ncaught in its clothing and held it there. It struggled to free\nitself; and in the next minute he rushed up and clutched it fast.\n”Why don’t you ﬂoat over the treetops?” he panted ironically.\n”Ghosts have no business getting their spirit raiment tangled up\nin a barbed-wire fence.”\nIt answered with a little exclamation, with a sob following close\nupon it. There was a sound of tearing cloth, and he held his\ncaptive upright, and with a merciless hand turned her face so\nthat the moonlight struck it full. They stared at each other,\nbreathing hard from more than the race they had run.\n”Well–I’ll–be–” Grant began, in blank amazement.\nShe wriggled her chin in his palm, trying to free herself from\nhis pitiless staring. Failing that, she began to sob angrily\nwithout any tears in her wide eyes.\n”You–shot me, you brute!” she cried accusingly at last.\n”You–SHOT me!” And she sobbed again.\nBefore he answered, he drew backward a step or two, sat down upon\nthe edge of a rock which had rolled out from a stone-heap, and\npulled her down beside him, still holding her fast, as if he half\nbelieved her capable of soaring away over the treetops, after\nall.\n37\n”I guess I didn’t murder you–from the chase you gave me. Did I\nhit you at all?”\n”Yes, you did! You nearly broke my arm–and you might have killed\nme, you big brute! Look what you did–and I never harmed you at\nall!” She pushed up a sleeve, and held out her arm accusingly in\nthe moonlight, disclosing a tiny, red furrow where the skin was\nbroken and still bleeding. ”And you shot a big hole right\nthrough Aunt Phoebe’s sheet!” she added, with tearful severity.\nHe caught her arm, bent his head over it–and for a moment he was\nperilously near to kissing it; an impulse which astonished him\nconsiderably, and angered him more. He dropped the arm rather\nprecipitately; and she lifted it again, and regarded the wound\nwith mournful interest.\n”I’d like to know what right you have to prowl around shooting at\npeople,” she scolded, seeing how close she could come to touching\nthe place with her ﬁngertips without producing any but a\npleasurable pain.\n”Just as much right as you have to get up in the middle of the\nnight and go ahowling all over the ranch wrapped up in a sheet,”\nhe retorted ungallantly.\n”Well, if I want to do it, I don’t see why you need concern\nyourself about it. I wasn’t doing it for your beneﬁt, anyway.”\n”Will you tell me what you DID do it for? Of all the silly\ntomfoolery–”\nAn impish smile quite obliterated the Christmas-angel look for an\ninstant, then vanished, and left her a pretty, abused maiden who\nis grieved at harsh treatment.\n”Well, I wanted to scare Gene,” she confessed. ”I did, too. I\njust know he’s a cowardy-cat, because he’s always trying to scare\nME. It’s Gene’s fault–he told me the grove is haunted. He said\na long time ago, before Uncle Hart settled here, a lot of Indians\nwaylaid a wagon-train here and killed a girl, and he says that\nwhen the moon is just past the full, something white walks\nthrough the grove and wails like a lost soul in torment. He says\nsometimes it comes and moans at the corner of the house where my\nroom is. I just know he was going to do it himself; but I guess\nhe forgot. So I thought I’d see if he believed his own yarns. I\nwas going to do it every night till I scared him into sleeping in\nthe house. I had a perfectly lovely place to disappear into,\nwhere he couldn’t trace me if he took to hunting around–only he\nwouldn’t dare.” She pulled down her sleeve very carefully, and\n38\nthen, just as carefully, she pushed it up again, and took another\nlook.\n”My best friend TOLD me I’d get shot if I came to Idaho,” she\nreminded herself, with a melancholy satisfaction.\n”You didn’t get shot,” Grant contradicted for the sake of drawing\nmore sparks of temper where temper seemed quaintly out of place,\nand stared hard at her drooping proﬁle. ”You just got nicely\nmissed; a bullet that only scrapes oﬀ a little skin can’t be\nsaid to hit. I’d hate to hit a bear like that.”\n”I believe you’re wishing you HAD killed me! You might at least\nhave some conscience in the matter, and be sorry you shot a lady.\nBut you’re not. You just wish you had murdered me. You hate\ngirls–you said so. And I don’t know what business it is of\nyours, if I want to play a joke on my cousin, or why you had to\nbe sleeping outside, anyway. I’ve a perfect right to be a ghost\nif I choose–and I don’t call it nice, or polite, or gentlemanly\nfor you to chase me all over the place with a gun, trying to kill\nme! I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live. When I say\nthat I mean it. I never liked you from the very start, when I\nﬁrst saw you this afternoon. Now I hate and despise you. I\nsuppose I oughtn’t to expect you to apologize or be sorry because\nyou almost killed me. I suppose that’s just your real nature\ncoming to the surface. Indians love to hurt and torture people!\nI shouldn’t have expected anything else of you, I suppose. I\nmade the mistake of treating you like a white man.”\n”Don’t you think you’re making another mistake right now?”\nGrant’s whole attitude changed, as well as his tone. ”Aren’t you\nafraid to push the white man down into the dirt, and raise\nup–the INDIAN?”\nShe cast a swift, half-frightened glance up into his face and the\neyes that glowed ominously in the moonlight.\n”When people make the blunder of calling up the Indian,” he went\non steadily, ”they usually ﬁnd that they have to deal with–the\nIndian.”\nEvadna looked at him again, and turned slowly white before her\ntemper surged to the surface again.\n”I didn’t call up the Indian,” she defended hotly; ”but if the\nIndian wants to deal with me according to his nature–why, let\nhim! But you don’t ACT like other people! I don’t know another\nman who wouldn’t have been horriﬁed at shooting me, even such a\ntiny little bit; but you don’t care at all. You never even said\nyou were sorry.”\n39\n”I’m not in the habit of saying all I think and feel.”\n”You were quick enough to apologize, after supper there, when you\nhadn’t really done anything; and now, when one would expect you\nto be at least decently sorry, you–you–well, you act like the\nsavage you are! There, now! It may not be nice to say it, but\nit’s the truth.”\nGrant smiled bitterly. ”All men are savages under the skin,” he\nsaid. ”How do YOU know what I think and feel? If I fail to come\nthrough with the conventional patter, I am called an\nIndian–because my mother was a half-breed.” He threw up his\nhead proudly, let his eyes rest for a moment upon the moon,\nswimming through a white river of clouds just over the tall\npoplar hedge planted long ago to shelter the orchard from the\nsweeping west winds; and, when he looked down at her again, he\ncaught a glimpse of repentant tears in her eyes, and softened.\n”Oh, you’re a girl, and you demand the usual amount of poor-pussy\ntalk,” he told her maliciously. ”So I’m sorry. I’m heartbroken.\nIf it will help any, I’ll even kiss the hurt to make it well–and\nI’m not a kissing young man, either, let me tell you.”\n”I’d die before I’d let you touch me!” Her repentance, if it was\nthat, changed to pure rage. She snatched the torn sheet from him\nand turned abruptly toward the fence. He followed her,\napparently unmoved by her attitude; placed his foot upon the\nlower wire and pressed it into the soft earth, lifted the one\nnext above it as high as it would go, and thus made it easier for\nher to pass through. She seemed to hesitate for a moment, as\nthough tempted to reject even that slight favor, then stooped,\nand went through.\nAs the wires snapped into place, she halted and looked back at\nhim.\n”Maybe I’ve been mean–but you’re been meaner,” she summed up, in\nself-justiﬁcation. ”I suppose the next thing you will do will\nbe to tell the boys. Well, I don’t care what you do, so long as\nyou never speak to me again. Go and tell them if you want\nto–tell. TELL, do you hear ? I don’t want even the favor of\nyour silence!” She dexterously tucked the bundle of white under\nthe uninjured arm, caught the loose folds of her skirt up in her\nhands, and ran away up the path, not once stopping to see whether\nhe still followed her.\nGrant did not follow. He stood leaning against the fence-post,\nand watched her until her ﬂying form grew indistinct in the\nshade of the poplar hedge; watched it reappear in a broad strip\n40\nof white moonlight, still running; saw it turn, slacken speed to\na walk, and then lose itself in the darkness of the grove.\nFive minutes, ten minutes, he stood there, staring across the\nlevel bit of valley lying quiet at the foot of the jagged-rimmed\nbluﬀ standing boldly up against the star-ﬂecked sky. Then he\nshook himself impatiently, muttered something which had to do\nwith a ”doddering fool,” and retraced his steps quickly through\ntho orchard, the currant bushes, and the strawberry patch,\njumped the ditch, and so entered the grove and returned to his\nblankets.\n”We thought the spook had got yuh, sure.” Gene lifted his head\nturtlewise and laughed deprecatingly. ”We was just about ready\nto start out after the corpse, only we didn’t know but what you\nmight get excited and take a shot at us in the dark. We heard\nyuh shoot–what was it? Did you ﬁnd out?”\n”It wasn’t anything,” said Grant shortly, tugging at a boot.\n”Ah–there was, too! What was it you shot at?” Clark joined in\nthe argument from the blackness under the locust tree.\n”The moon,” Grant told him sullenly. ”There wasn’t anything else\nthat I could see.”\n”And that’s a lie,” Gene amended, with the frankness of a\nfoster-brother. ”Something yelled like–”\n”You never heard a screech-owl before, did you, Gene?” Grant\ncrept between his blankets and snuggled down, as if his mind held\nnothing more important than sleep.\n”Screech-owl my granny! You bumped into something you couldn’t\nhandle–if you want to know what Ithink about it,” Clark\nguessed shrewdly. ”I wish now I’d taken the trouble to hunt the\nthing down; it didn’t seem worth while getting up. But I leave\nit to Gene if you ain’t mad enough to murder whatever it was.\nWhat was it?”\nHe waited a moment without getting a reply.\n”Well, keep your teeth shut down on it, then, darn yuh!” he\ngrowled. ”That’s the Injun of it–I know YOU! Screech-owl–huh!\nYou said when you left it was an Indian–and that’s why we didn’t\ntake after it ourselves. We don’t want to get the whole bunch\ndown on us like they are on you–and if there was one acting up\naround here, we knew blamed well it was on your account for what\nhappened to-day. I guess you found out, all right. I knew the\nminute you heaved in sight that you was just about as mad as you\n41\ncan get–and that’s saying a whole lot. If it WAS an Indian, and\nyou killed him, you better let us–”\n”Oh, for the lord’s sake, WILL YOU SHUT UP!” Grant raised to an\nelbow, glared a moment, and lay down again.\nThe result proved the sort of fellow he was. Clark shut up\nwithout even trailing oﬀ into mumbling to himself, as was his\nhabit when argument brought him defeat.\nCHAPTER VII\nMISS GEORGIE HOWARD, OPERATOR\n”Where is the delightful Mr. Good Indian oﬀ to?” Evadna stopped\ndrumming upon the gatepost and turned toward the person she heard\ncoming up behind her, who happened to be Gene. He stopped to\nlight a match upon the gate and put his cigarette to work before\nhe answered her; and Evadna touched tentatively the wide, blue\nribbon wound round her arm and tied in a bow at her elbow, and\neyed him guardedly.\n”Straight up, he told me,” Gene answered sourly. ”He’s sore over\nsomething that happened last night, and he didn’t seem to have\nany talk to give away this morning. He can go to the dickens,\nfor all I care.”\n”WHAT–happened last night?” Evadna wore her Christmas-angel\nexpression; and her tone was the sweet, insipid tone of childlike\ninnocence.\nGene hesitated. It seemed a sheer waste of opportunity to tell\nher the truth when she would believe a falsehood just as readily;\nbut, since the truth happened to be quite as improbable as a lie,\nhe decided to speak it.\n”There was a noise when the moon had just come up–didn’t you\nhear it? The ghost I told you about. Good Injun went after it\nwith a gun, and I guess they mixed, all right, and he got the\nworst of it. He was sure on the ﬁght when he came back, and\nhe’s pulled out this morning–”\n”Do you mean to tell me–did you see it, really?”\n”Well, you ask Clark, when you see him,” Gene hinted darkly.\n”You just ask him what was in the grove last night. Ask him what\n42\nhe HEARD.” He moved closer, and laid his hand impressively upon\nher arm. Evadna winced perceptibly. ”What yuh jumping for? You\ndidn’t see anything, did you?”\n”No; but–was there REALLY something?” Evadna freed herself as\nunobtrusively as possible, and looked at him with wide eyes.\n”You ask Clark. He’ll tell you–maybe. Good Injun’s scared\nclean oﬀ the ranch–you can see that for yourself. He said he\ncouldn’t be hired to spend another night here. He thinks it’s a\nbad sign. That’s the Injun of it. They believe in spirits and\nsigns and things.”\nEvadna turned thoughtful. ”And didn’t he tell you what he–that\nis, if he found out–you said he went after it–”\n”He wouldn’t say a blamed thing about it,” Gene complained\nsincerely. ”He said there wasn’t anything–he told us it was a\nscreech-owl.”\n”Oh!” Evadna gave a sigh of relief. ”Well, I’m going to ask\nClark what it was–I’m just crazy about ghost stories, only I\nnever would DARE leave the house after dark if there are funny\nnoises and things, really. I think you boys must be the bravest\nfellows, to sleep out there–without even your mother with you!”\nShe smiled the credulous smile of ignorant innocence and pulled\nthe gate open.\n”Jack promised to take me up to Hartley to-day,” she explained\nover her shoulder. ”When I come back, you’ll show me just where\nit was, won’t you, Gene? You don’t suppose it would walk in the\ngrove in the daytime, do you? Because I’m awfully fond of the\ngrove, and I do hope it will be polite enough to conﬁne its\nperambulations entirely to the conventional midnight hour.”\nGene did not make any reply. Indeed, he seemed wholly absorbed\nin staring after her and wondering just how much or how little of\nit she meant.\nEvadna looked back, midway between the gate and the stable, and,\nwhen she saw him standing exactly as she had left him, she waved\nher hand and smiled. She was still smiling when she came up to\nwhere Jack was giving those last, tentative twitches and pats\nwhich prove whether a saddle is properly set and cinched; and she\nwould not say what it was that amused her. All the way up the\ngrade, she smiled and grew thoughtful by turns; and, when Jack\nmentioned the fact that Good Indian had gone oﬀ mad about\nsomething, she contented herself with the simple, unqualiﬁed\nstatement that she was glad of it.\n43\nGrant’s horse dozed before the store, and Grant himself sat upon\na bench in the narrow strip of shade on the porch. Evadna,\ntherefore, refused absolutely to dismount there, though her\nerrand had been a post-oﬃce money order. Jack was already on\nthe ground when she made known her decision; and she left him in\nthe middle of his expostulations and rode on to the depot. He\nfollowed disapprovingly afoot; and, when she brought her horse to\na stand, he helped her from the saddle, and took the bridle reins\nwith an air of weary tolerance.\n”When you get ready to go home, you can come to the store,” he\nsaid bluntly. ”Huckleberry wouldn’t stand here if you hog-tied\nhim. Just remember that if you ever ride up here alone–it might\nsave you a walk back. And say,” he added, with a return of his\ngood-natured grin, ”it looks like you and Good Injun didn’t get\nacquainted yesterday. I thought I saw mum give him an\nintroduction to you–but I guess I made a mistake. When you come\nto the store, don’t let me forget, and I’ll do it myself.”\n”Oh, thank you, Jack–but it isn’t necessary,” chirped Evadna,\nand left him with the smile which he had come to regard with\nvague suspicion of what it might hide of her real feelings.\nTwo squaws sat cross-legged on the ground in the shade of the\nlittle red depot; and them she passed by hastily, her eyes upon\nthem watchfully until she was well upon the platform and was\nbeing greeted joyfully by Miss Georgie Howard, then in one of her\ndaily periods of intense boredom.\n”My, my, but you’re an angel of deliverance–and by rights you\nshould have a pair of gauze wings, just to complete the picture,”\nshe cried, leading her inside and pushing her into a beribboned\nwicker rocker. ”I was just getting desperate enough to haul in\nthose squaws out there and see if I couldn’t teach ’em whist or\nsomething.” She sat down and ﬁngered her pompadour absently.\n”And that sure would have been interesting,” she added musingly.\n”Don’t let me interrupt you,” Evadna began primly. ”I only came\nfor a money order–Aunt Phoebe’s sending for–”\n”Never mind what you came for,” Miss Georgie cut in decisively,\nand laughed. ”The express agent is out. You can’t get your\norder till we’ve had a good talk and got each other tagged\nmentally–only I’ve tagged you long ago.”\n”I thought you were the express agent. Aunt Phoebe said–”\n”Nice, truthful Aunt Phoebe! I am, but I’m out–oﬃcially. I’m\nseveral things, my dear; but, for the sake of my own dignity and\n44\nself-respect, I refuse to be more than one of them at a time.\nWhen I sell a ticket to Shoshone, I’m the ticket agent, and\nnothing else. Telegrams, I’m the operator. At certain times I’m\nthe express agent. I admit it. But this isn’t one of the\ntimes.”\nShe stopped and regarded her visitor with whimsical appraisement.\n”You’ll wait till the agent returns, won’t you?” And added, with\na grimace: ”You won’t be in the way–I’m not anything oﬃcial\nright now. I’m a neighbor, and this is my parlor–you see, I\nplanted you on that rug, with the books at your elbow, and that\ngeranium also; and you’re in the rocker, so you’re really and\ntruly in my parlor. I’m over the line myself, and you’re calling\non me. Sabe? That little desk by the safe is the express\noﬃce, and you can see for yourself that the agent is out.”\n”Well, upon my word!” Evadna permitted herself that much\nemotional relief. Then she leaned her head against the\ncherry-colored head-rest tied to the chair with huge,\ncherry-colored bows, and took a deliberate survey of the room.\nIt was a small room, as rooms go. One corner was evidently the\ntelegraph oﬃce, for it held a crude table, with the instruments\nclicking spasmodically, form pads, letter ﬁles, and mysterious\nthings which piqued her curiosity. Over it was a railroad map\nand a makeshift bulletin board, which seemed to give the time of\ncertain trains. And small-paned windows gave one sitting before\ntho instruments an unobstructed view up and down the track. In\nthe corner behind the door was a small safe, with door ajar, and\na desk quite as small, with, ”Express Oﬃce: Hours, 8 A.M. to 6\nP.M.” on a card above it.\nUnder a small window opening upon the platform was another little\ntable, with indications of occasional ticket-selling upon it.\nAnd in the end of the room where she sat were various little\nadornments–”art” calendars, a few books, fewer potted plants, a\nsewing-basket, and two rugs upon the ﬂoor, with a rocker for\neach. Also there was a tiny, square table, with a pack of cards\nscattered over it.\n”Exactly. You have it sized up correctly, my dear.” Miss\nGeorgie Howard nodded her–head three times, and her eyes were\nmirthful.” It’s a game. I made it a game. I had to, in\nself-defense. Otherwise–” She waved a hand conspicuous for its\nwhite plumpness and its ﬁngers tapering beautifully to little,\npink nails immaculately kept. ”I took at the job and the place\njust as it stands, without anything in the way of mitigation.\nCan you see yourself holding it down for longer than a week?\nI’ve been here a month.”\n45\n”I think,” Evadna ventured, ”it must be fun.”\n”Oh, yes. It’s fun–if you make fun OF it. However, before we\nsettle down for a real visit, I’ve a certain duty to perform, if\nyou will excuse my absence for a moment. Incidentally,” she\nadded, getting lazily out of the chair, ”it will illustrate just\nhow I manage my system.”\nHer absence was purely theoretical. She stepped oﬀ the rug,\nwent to the ”express oﬃce,” and took a card from the desk.\nWhen she had stood it upright behind the inkwell, Evadna read in\nlarge, irregular capitals:\n”OUT. WILL BE BACK LATER.”\nMiss Georgie Howard paid no attention to the little giggle which\nwent with the reading, but stepped across to the ticket desk and\nto the telegraph table, and put similar cards on display. Then\nshe came back to the rug, plumped down in her rocker with a sigh\nof relief, and reached for a large, white box–the ﬁve pounds of\nchocolates which she had sent for.\n”I never eat candy when I’m in the oﬃce,” she observed soberly.\n”I consider it unprofessional. Help yourself as liberally as\nyour digestion will stand–and for Heaven’s sake, gossip a\nlittle! Tell me all about that bunch of nifty lads I see\ncavorting around the store occasionally–and especially about the\npolysyllabic gentleman who seems to hang out at the Peaceful Hart\nranch. I’m terribly taken with him. He–excuse me, chicken.\nThere’s a fellow down the line hollering his head oﬀ. Wait till\nI see what he wants.”\nAgain she left the rug, stepped to the telegraph instrument, and\nﬁngered the key daintily until she had, with the other hand,\nturned down the ”out” card. Then she threw the switch, rattled\nan impatient reply, and waited, listening to the rapid clicking\nof the sounder. Her eyes and her mouth hardened as she read.\n”Cad!” she gritted under her breath. Her ﬁngers were spiteful\nas they clicked the key in answer. She slammed the current oﬀ,\nset up the ”out” notice again, kicked the desk chair against the\nwall, and came back to the ”parlor” breathing quickly.\n”I think it must be perfectly fascinating to talk that way to\npersons miles oﬀ,” said Evadna, eying the chittering sounder\nwith something approaching awe. ”I watched your ﬁngers, and\ntried to imagine what it was they were saying–but I couldn’t\neven guess.”\nMiss Georgie Howard laughed queerly. ”No, I don’t suppose you\n46\ncould,” she murmured, and added, with a swift glance at the\nother: ”They said, ’You go to the devil.’” She held up the\noﬀending hand and regarded it intently. ”You wouldn’t think it\nof them, would you? But they have to say things sometimes–in\nself-defense. There are two or three fresh young men along the\nline that can’t seem to take a hint unless you knock them in the\nhead with it.”\nShe cast a malevolent look at the clicking instrument. ”He’s\ntrying to square himself,” she observed carelessly. ”But,\nunfortunately, I’m out. He seems on the verge of tears, poor\nthing.”\nShe poked investigatingly among the chocolates, and ﬁnally\nselected a delectable morsel with epicurean care.\n”You haven’t told me about the polysyllabic young man,” she\nreminded. ”He has held my heart in bondage since he said to Pete\nHamilton yesterday in the store–ah–” She leaned and barely\nreached a slip of paper which was lying upon a row of books. ”I\nwrote it down so I wouldn’t forget it,” she explained\nparenthetically. ”He said to Pete, in the store, just after Pete\nhad tried to say something funny with the usual lamentable\nfailure–um–’You are mentally incapable of recognizing the line\nof demarcation between legitimate persiﬂage and objectionable\nfamiliarity.’ Now, I want to know what sort of a man, under ﬁfty\nand not a college professor, would–or could–say that without\nstudying it ﬁrst. It sounded awfully impromptu and easy–and\nyet he looks–well, cowboyish. What sort of a young man is he?”\n”He’s a perfectly horrid young man.” Evadna leaned to help\nherself to more chocolates. ”He–well, just to show you how\nhorrid, he calls me a–a Christmas angel! And–”\n”Did he!” Miss Georgie eyed her measuringly between bites. ”Tag\nhim as being intelligent, a keen observer, with the ability to\nexpress himself–” She broke oﬀ, and turned her head\nungraciously toward the sounder, which seemed to be repeating\nsomething over and over with a good deal of insistence. ”That’s\nShoshone calling,” she said, frowning attentively. ”They’ve got\nan old crank up there in the oﬃce–I’d know his touch among a\nmillion–and when he calls he means business. I’ll have to speak\nup, I suppose.” She sighed, tucked a chocolate into her cheek,\nand went scowling to the table. ”Can’t the idiot see I’m out?”\nshe complained whimsically. ”What’s that card for, I wonder?”\nShe threw the switch, rattled a reply, and then, as the sounder\nsettled down to a steady click-clickety-click-click, she drew a\npad toward her, pulled up the chair with her foot, sat down, and\nbegan to write the message as it came chattering over the wire.\n47\nWhen it was ﬁnished and the sounder quiet, her hand awoke to\nlife upon the key. She seemed to be repeating the message, word\nfor word. When she was done, she listened, got her answer, threw\noﬀ the switch with a sweep of her thumb, and fumbled among the\npapers on the table until she found an envelope. She addressed\nit with a hasty scrawl of her pencil, sealed it with a vicious\nlittle spat of her hand, and then sat looking down upon it\nthoughtfully.\n”I suppose I’ve got to deliver that immediately, at once, without\ndelay,” she said. ”There’s supposed to be an answer. Chicken,\nsome queer things happen in this business. Here’s that\nweak-eyed, hollow-chested Saunders, that seems to have just life\nenough to put in about ten hours a day reading ’The Duchess,’\ngetting cipher messages like the hero of a detective story. And\nsending them, too, by the way. We operators are not supposed to\nthink; but all the same–” She got her receipt-book, ﬁlled\nrapidly a blank line, tucked it under her arm, and went up and\ntapped Evadna lightly upon the head with the envelope. ”Want to\ncome along? Or would you rather stay here? I won’t be more than\ntwo minutes.”\nShe was gone ﬁve; and she returned with a preoccupied air which\nlasted until she had disposed of three chocolates and was\ncarefully choosing a fourth.\n”Chicken,” she said then, quietly, ”do you know anything about\nyour uncle and his aﬀairs?” And added immediately: ”The chances\nare ten to one you don’t, and wouldn’t if you lived there till\nyou were gray?”\n”I know he’s perfectly lovely,” Evadna asserted warmly. ”And so\nis Aunt Phoebe.”\n”To be sure.” Miss Georgie smiled indulgently. ”I quite agree\nwith you. And by the way, I met that polysyllabic cowboy\nagain–and I discovered that, on the whole, my estimate was\nincorrect. He’s emphatically monosyllabic. I said sixteen nice\nthings to him while I was waiting for Pete to wake up Saunders;\nand he answered in words of one syllable; one word, of one\nsyllable. I’m beginning to feel that I’ve simply got to know\nthat young man. There are deeps there which I am wild to\nexplore. I never met any male human in the least like him. Did\nyou? So absolutely–ah–inscrutable, let us say.”\n”That’s just because he’s part Indian,” Evadna declared, with the\npositiveness of youth and inexperience. ”It isn’t\ninscrutability, but stupidity. I simply can’t bear him. He’s\nbrutal, and rude. He told me–told me, mind you–that he doesn’t\nlike women. He actually warned me against thinking his\n48\npoliteness–if he ever is polite, which I doubt–means more than\njust common humanity. He said he didn’t want me to misunderstand\nhim and think he liked me, because he doesn’t. He’s a perfect\nsavage. I simply loathe him!”\n”I’d certainly see that he repented, apologized, and vowed\neternal devotion,” smiled Miss Georgie. ”That should be my\nrevenge.”\n”I don’t want any revenge. I simply want nothing to do with him.\nI don’t want to speak to him, even.”\n”He’s awfully good–looking,” mused Miss Georgie.\n”He looks to me just like an Indian. He ought to wear a blanket,\nlike the rest.”\n”Then you’re no judge. His eyes are dark; but they aren’t snaky,\nmy dear. His hair is real wavy, did you notice? And he has the\ndearest, ﬁrm mouth. I noticed it particularly, because I admire\na man who’s a man. He’s one. He’d ﬁght and never give up, once\nhe started. And I think”–she spoke hesitatingly– ”I think he’d\nlove–and never give up; unless the loved one disappointed him in\nsome way; and then he’d be strong enough to go his way and not\nwhine about it. I do hate a whiner! Don’t you?”\nA shadow fell upon the platform outside the door, and Saunders\nappeared, sidling deprecatingly into the room. He pulled oﬀ his\nblack, slouched hat and tucked it under his arm, smoothed his\nlank, black hair, ran his palm down over his lank, unshaven face\nwith a smoothing gesture, and sidled over to the telegraph table.\n”Here’s the answer to that message,” he said, in a limp tone,\nwithout any especial emphasis or inﬂection. ”If you ain’t too\nbusy, and could send it right oﬀ–it’s to go C.O.D. and make\n’em repeat it, so as to be sure–”\n”Certainly, Mr. Saunders.” Miss Georgie rose, the crisp,\nbusinesslike operator, and went to the table. She took the sheet\nof paper from him with her ﬁnger tips, as if he were some\nrepulsive creature whose touch would send her shuddering, and\nglanced at the message. ”Write it on the regular form,” she\nsaid, and pushed a pad and pencil toward him.” I have to place\nit on ﬁle.” Whereupon she turned her back upon him, and stood\nstaring down the railroad track through the smoke-grimed window\nuntil a movement warned her that he was through.\n”Very well–that is all,” she said, after she had counted the\nwords twice. ”Oh–you want to wait for the repeat.”\n49\nShe laid her ﬁngers on the key and sent the message in a whirl\nof chittering little sounds, waited a moment while the sounder\nspoke, paused, and then began a rapid clicking, which was the\nrepeated message, and wrote it down upon its form.\n”There–if it’s correct, that’s all,” she told him in a tone of\ndismissal, and waited openly for him to go. Which he did, after\na sly glance at Evadna, a licking of pale lips, as if he would\nspeak but lacked the courage, and a leering grin at Miss Georgie.\nHe was no sooner over the threshold than she slammed the door\nshut, in spite of the heat. She walked to the window, glanced\ndown the track again, turned to the table, and restlessly\narranged the form pads, sticking the message upon the ﬁle. She\nsaid something under her breath, snapped the cover on the\ninkwell, sighed, patted her pompadour, and ﬁnally laughed at her\nown uneasiness.\n”Whenever that man comes in here,” she observed impatiently, ”I\nalways feel as if I ought to clean house after him. If ever\nthere was a human toad–or snake, or–ugh! And what does he\nmean–sending twenty-word messages that don’t make sense when you\nread them over, and getting others that are just a lot of words\njumbled together, hit or miss? I wish–only it’s unprofessional\nto talk about it–but, just the same, there’s some nasty business\nbrewing, and I know it. I feel guilty, almost, every time I send\none of those cipher messages.”\n”Maybe he’s a detective,” Evadna hazarded.\n”Maybe.” Miss Georgie’s tone, however, was extremely skeptical.\n”Only, so far as I can discover, there’s never been anything\naround here to detect. Nobody has been murdered, or robbed, or\nkidnapped that I ever heard of. Pete Hamilton says not. And–I\nwonder, now, if Saunders could be watching somebody! Wouldn’t it\nbe funny, if old Pete himself turned out to be a Jesse James\nbrand of criminal? Can you imagine Pete doing anything more\nbrutal than lick a postage stamp?”\n”He might want to,” Evadna guessed shrewdly, ”but it would be too\nmuch trouble.”\n”Besides,” Miss Georgie went on speculating, ”Saunders never does\nanything that anyone ever heard of. Sweeps out the store, they\nsay–but I’d hate to swear to that. Inever could catch it\nwhen it looked swept–and brings the mail sack over here twice a\nday, and gets one to take back. And reads novels. Of course,\nthe man’s half dead with consumption; but no one would object to\nthat, if these queer wires hadn’t commenced coming to him.”\n50\n”Why don’t you turn detective yourself and ﬁnd out?” Plainly,\nEvadna was secretly laughing at her perturbed interest in the\nmatter.\n”Thanks. I’m too many things already, and I haven’t any false\nhair or dark lantern. And, by the way, I’m going to have the day\noﬀ, Sunday. Charlie Green is coming up to relieve me.\nAnd–couldn’t we do something?” She glanced wearily around the\nlittle oﬃce. ”Honest, I’d go crazy if I stayed here much\nlonger without a play spell. I want to get clear out, away from\nthe thing–where I can’t even hear a train whistle.”\n”Then you shall come down to the ranch the minute you can get\naway, and we’ll do something or go somewhere. The boys said\nthey’d take me ﬁshing–but they only propose things so they can\nplay jokes on me, it seems to me. They’d make me fall in the\nriver, or something, I just know. But if you’d like to go along,\nthere’d be two of us–”\n”Chicken, we’ll go. I ought to be ashamed to ﬁsh for an\ninvitation the way I did, but I’m not. I haven’t been down to\nthe Hart ranch yet; and I’ve heard enough about it to drive me\ncrazy with the desire to see it. Your Aunt Phoebe I’ve met, and\nfallen in love with–that’s a matter of course. She told me to\nvisit her just any time, without waiting to be invited\nespecially. Isn’t she the dearest thing? Oh! that’s a train\norder, I suppose–sixteen is about due. Excuse me, chicken.”\nShe was busy then until the train came screeching down upon the\nstation, paused there while the conductor rushed in, got a thin\nslip of paper for himself and the engineer, and rushed out again.\nWhen the train grumbled away from the platform and went its way,\nit left man standing there, a ﬁsh-basket slung from one\nshoulder, a trout rod carefully wrapped in its case in his hand,\na box which looked suspiciously like a case of some bottled joy\nat his feet, and a loose-lipped smile upon his face.\n”Howdy, Miss Georgie?” he called unctuously through the open\ndoor.\nMiss Georgie barely glanced at him from under her lashes, and her\nshoulders indulged themselves in an almost imperceptible twitch.\n”How do you do, Mr. Baumberger?” she responded coolly, and very,\nvery gently pushed the door shut just as he had made up his mind\nto enter.\n51\nCHAPTER VIII\nTHE AMIABLE ANGLER\nBaumberger–Johannes was the name he answered to when any of his\nfamily called, though to the rest of the world he was simply\nBaumberger–was what he himself called a true sport. Women, he\nmaintained, were very much like trout; and so, when this\nparticular woman calmly turned her back upon the smile cast at\nher, he did not linger there angling uselessly, but betook\nhimself to the store, where his worldly position, rather than his\ncharming personality, might be counted upon to bring him his meed\nof appreciation.\nGood Indian and Jack, sitting side by side upon the porch and\nsaying very little, he passed by with a careless nod, as being\nnot worth his attention. Saunders, glancing up from the\nabsorbing last chapter of ”The Brokenhearted Bride,” also\nreceived a nod, and returned it apathetically. Pete Hamilton,\nhowever, got a ﬂabby handshake, a wheezy laugh, and the\nannouncement that he was down from Shoshone for a good, gamy\ntussle with that four-pounder he had lost last time.\n”And I don’t go back till I get him–not if I stay here a week,”\nhe declared, with jocular savagery. ”Took half my leader and my\npet ﬂy–I got him with a peacock-bodied gray hackle that I\nrevised to suit my own notions–and, by the great immortal\nJehosaphat, he looked like a whale when he jumped up clear of tho\nriﬄe, turned over, and–” His ﬂabby, white hand made a soaring\nmovement to indicate the manner in which the four-pounder had\nvanished.\n”Better take a day oﬀ and go with me, Pete,” he suggested,\ngetting an unwieldy-looking pipe from the pocket of his canvas\nﬁshing-coat, and opening his eyes at a trout-ﬂy snagged in the\nmouthpiece. ”Now, how did that ﬂy come there?” he asked\naggrievedly, while he released it daintily for all his ﬁngers\nlooked so fat and awkward. He stuck the pipe in the corner of\nhis mouth, and held up the ﬂy with that interest which seems\nfatuous to one who has no sporting blood in his veins.\n”Last time I used that ﬂy was when I was down here three weeks\nago–the day I lost the big one. Ain’t it a beauty, eh? Tied it\nmyself. And, by the great immortal Jehosaphat, it fetches me the\nrainbows, too. Good mind to try it on the big one. Don’t see\nhow I didn’t miss it out of my book–I must be getting\nabsent-minded. Sign of old age, that. Failing powers and the\nlike.” He shook his head reprovingly and grinned, as if he\n52\nconsidered the idea something of a joke. ”Have to buck up–a\nlawyer can’t aﬀord to grow absent-minded. He’s liable to wake\nup some day and ﬁnd himself without his practice.”\nHe got his ﬂy-book from the basket swinging at his left hip,\nopened it, turned the leaves with the caressing touch one gives\nto a cherished thing, and very carefully placed the ﬂy upon the\npage where it belonged; gazed gloatingly down at the tiny, tufted\nhooks, with their frail-looking ﬁve inches of gut leader, and\nthen returned the book fondly to the basket.\n”Think I’ll go on down to the Harts’,” he said, ”so as to be that\nmuch closer to the stream. Daylight is going to ﬁnd me whipping\nthe riﬄes, Peter. You won’t come along? You better. Plenty\nof–ah–snake medicine,” he hinted, chuckling so that the whole,\ndeep chest of him vibrated. ”No? Well, you can let me have a\nhorse, I suppose–that cow-backed sorrel will do–he’s gentle, I\nknow. I think I’ll go out and beg an invitation from that Hart\nboy–never can remember those kids by name–Gene, is it, or\nJack?”\nHe went out upon the porch, laid a hand upon Jack’s shoulder, and\nbeamed down upon him with what would have passed easily for real\naﬀection while he announced that he was going to beg supper and\na bed at the ranch, and wanted to know, as a solicitous\nafter-thought, if Jack’s mother had company, or anything that\nwould make his presence a burden.\n”Nobody’s there–and, if there was, it wouldn’t matter,” Jack\nassured him carelessly. ”Go on down, if you want to. It’ll be\nall right with mother.”\n”One thing I like about ﬁshing down here,” chuckled Baumberger,\nhis fat ﬁngers still resting lightly upon Jack’s shoulder, ”is\nthe pleasure of eating my ﬁsh at your house. There ain’t\nanother man, woman, or child in all Idaho can fry trout like your\nmother. You needn’t tell her I said so–but it’s a fact, just\nthe same. She sure is a genius with the frying-pan, my boy.”\nHe turned and called in to Pete, to know if he might have the\nsorrel saddled right away. Since Pete looked upon Baumberger\nwith something of the awed admiration which he would bestow upon\nthe President, he felt convinced that his horses were to be\ncongratulated that any one of them found favor in his eyes.\nPete, therefore, came as near to roaring at Saunders as his good\nnature and his laziness would permit, and waited in the doorway\nuntil Saunders had, with visible reluctance, laid down his book\nand started toward the stable.\n53\n”Needn’t bother to bring the horse down here, my man,” Baumberger\ncalled after him. ”I’ll get him at the stable and start from\nthere. Well, wish me luck, Pete–and say! I’ll expect you to\nmake a day of it with me Sunday. No excuses, now. I’m going to\nstay over that long, anyhow. Promised myself three good\ndays–maybe more. A man’s got to break away from his work once\nin a while. If I didn’t, life wouldn’t be worth living. I’m\nwilling to grind–but I’ve got to have my playtime, too. Say, I\nwant you to try this rod of mine Sunday. You’ll want one like it\nyourself, if I’m any good at guessing. Just got it, you\nknow–it’s the one I was talking to yuh about last time I was\ndown.\n”W-ell–I reckon my means of conveyance is ready for me–so long,\nPeter, till Sunday. See you at supper, boys.”\nHe hooked a thumb under the shoulder-strap of his basket, pulled\nit to a more comfortable position, waved his hand in a farewell,\nwhich included every living thing within sight of him, and went\naway up the narrow, winding trail through the sagebrush to the\nstable, humming something under his breath with the same impulse\nof satisfaction with life which sets a cat purring.\nSome time later, he appeared, in the same jovial mood, at the\nHart ranch, and found there the welcome which he had counted\nupon–the welcome which all men received there upon demand.\nWhen Evadna and Jack rode up, they found Mr. Baumberger taking\nhis ease in Peaceful’s armchair on the porch, discussing, with\nanimated gravity, the ins and outs of county politics; his\nﬁshing-basket lying on its ﬂat side close to his chair, his rod\nleaning against the house at his elbow, his heavy pipe dragging\ndown one corner of his loose-lipped mouth; his whole gross person\nsurrounded by an atmosphere of prosperity leading the simple life\ntransiently and by choice, and of lazy enjoyment in his own\nphysical and mental well-being.\nCHAPTER IX\nPEPPAJEE JIM ”HEAP SABES”\nPeppajee Jim had meditated long in the shade of his wikiup, and\nnow, when the sun changed from a glaring ball of intense, yellow\nheat to a sullen red disk hanging low over the bluﬀs of Snake\nRiver, he rose, carefully knocked the ashes from his little stone\npipe, with one mechanical movement of his arms, gathered his\n54\nblanket around him, pushed a too-familiar dog from him with a\nshove of moccasined foot, and stalked away through the sagebrush.\nOn the brow of the hill, just where the faint footpath dipped\ninto a narrow gully at the very edge, almost, of the bluﬀ, he\nstopped, and lifted his head for an unconsciously haughty stare\nat his surroundings.\nBeneath him and half a mile or so up the river valley, the mellow\ngreen of Peaceful’s orchard was already taking to itself the\nvagueness of evening shadows. Nearer, the meadow of alfalfa and\nclover lay like a soft, green carpet of velvet, lined here and\nthere with the irrigation ditches which kept it so. And in the\ncenter of the meadow, a small inclosure marked grimly the spot\nwhere lay the bones of old John Imsen. All around the man-made\noasis of orchards and meadows, the sage and the sand, pushed from\nthe river by the jumble of placer pits, emphasized by sharp\ncontrast what man may do with the most unpromising parts of the\nearth’s surface, once he sets himself heart and muscle to the\ntask.\nWith the deliberation of his race, Peppajee stood long minutes\nmotionless, gazing into the valley before ho turned with a true\nIndian shrug and went down into the gully, up the steep slope\nbeyond, and then, after picking his way through a jumble of great\nbowlders, came out eventually into the dust-ridden trail of the\nwhite man. Down that he walked, erect, swift, purposeful, his\nmoccasins falling always with the precision of a wild animal upon\nthe best footing among the loose rocks, stubs of sage-roots, or\npatches of deep dust and sand beside the wagon-road, his sharp,\nhigh-featured face set in the stony calm which may hide a tumult\nof elemental passions beneath and give no sign.\nWhere the trail curved out sharply to round the Point o’ Rocks,\nhe left it, and kept straight on through the sage, entered a\nrough pass through the huge rock tongue, and came out presently\nto the trail again, a scant two hundred yards from the Hart\nhaystacks. When he reached the stable, he stopped and looked\nwarily about him, but there was no sight or sound of any there\nsave animals, and he went on silently to the house, his shadow\nstretching long upon the ground before him until it merged into\nthe shade of the grove beyond the gate, and so was lost for that\nday.\n”Hello, Peppajee,” called Wally over his cigarette. ”Just in\ntime for supper.”\nPeppajee grunted, stopped in the path two paces from the porch,\nfolded his arms inside his blanket, and stood so while his eyes\ntraveled slowly and keenly around the group lounging at ease\n55\nabove him. Upon the bulky ﬁgure of Baumberger they dwelt\nlongest, and while he looked his face hardened until nothing\nseemed alive but his eyes.\n”Peppajee, this my friend, Mr. Baumberger. You heap sabe\nBaumberger–come all time from Shoshone, mebbyso catchum heap\nmany ﬁsh.” Peaceful’s mild, blue eyes twinkled over his old\nmeerschaum. He knew the ways of Indians, and more particularly\nhe knew the ways of Peppajee; Baumberger, he guessed shrewdly,\nhad failed to ﬁnd favor in his eyes.\n”Huh!” grunted Peppajee non-commitally, and made no motion to\nshake hands, thereby conﬁrming Peaceful’s suspicion. ”Me heap\nsabe Man-that-catchum-ﬁsh.” After which he stood as before, his\narms folded tightly in his blanket, his chin lifted haughtily,\nhis mouth a straight, stern line of bronze.\n”Sit down, Peppajee. Bimeby eat supper,” Peaceful invited\npaciﬁcally, while Baumberger chuckled at the Indian’s attitude,\nwhich he attributed to racial stupidity.\nPeppajee did not even indicate that he heard or, hearing,\nunderstood.\n”Bothered much with Injuns?” Baumberger asked carelessly, putting\naway his pipe. ”I see there’s quite a camp of ’em up on the\nhill. Hope you’ve got good watchdogs–they’re a thieving lot.\nIf they’re a nuisance, Hart, I’ll see what can be done about\nslapping ’em back on their reservation, where they belong. I\nhappen to have some inﬂuence with the agent.”\n”I guess you needn’t go to any trouble about it,” Peaceful\nreturned dryly. ”I’ve had worse neighbors.”\n”Oh–if you’re stuck on their company!” laughed Baumberger\nwheezily. ”’Every fellow to his taste, as the old woman said\nwhen she kissed her cow.’ There may be good ones among the lot,”\nhe conceded politely when he saw that his time-worn joke had met\nwith disfavor, even by the boys, who could–and usually\ndid–laugh at almost anything. ”They all look alike to me, I\nmust admit; I never had any truck with ’em.”\n”No, I guess not,” Peaceful agreed in his slow way, holding his\npipe three inches from his face while he eyed Peppajee\nquizzically. ”Don’t pay to have any truck with ’em while you\nfeel that way about it.” He smoothed down his snow-white beard\nwith his free hand, pushed the pipe-stem between his teeth, and\nwent on smoking.\n”I never liked the breed, any way you look at ’em,” Baumberger\n56\nstated calmly.\n”Say, you’ll queer yourself good and plenty, if you keep on,”\nWally interrupted bluntly. ”Peppajee’s ears aren’t plugged with\ncotton–are they, Jim?”\nNeither Peppajee nor Baumberger made reply of any sort, and\nPeaceful turned his mild eyes reproachfully toward his untactful\nson. But the supper summons clanged insistently from the iron\ntriangle on the back porch and saved the situation from becoming\ntoo awkward. Even Baumberger let his tilted chair down upon its\nfour legs with a haste for which his appetite was not alone\nresponsible, and followed the boys into the house as if he were\nglad to escape from the steady, uncompromising stare of the\nIndian.\n”Better come and eat, Peppajee,” Peaceful lingered upon the porch\nto urge hospitably. ”You no get mad. You come eat supper.”\n”No!” Peppajee jerked the word out with unmistakable ﬁnality.\n”No eat. Bimeby mebbyso makum big talk yo’.”\nPeaceful studied his face, found it stern and unyielding, and\nnodded assent. ”All right. I eat, then I talk with you.” He\nturned somewhat reluctantly and followed the others inside,\nleaving Peppajee to pass the time away as pleased him best.\nPeppajee stood still for a moment listening to the clatter of\ndishes from the kitchen, and then with dignity end deliberation\nseated himself upon the lowest step of the porch, and, pulling\nhis blanket tight around him, resettled his disreputable old\nsombrero upon his head and stared ﬁxedly at the crimson glow\nwhich ﬁlled all the west and made even the rugged bluﬀ a\nwonderful thing of soft, rose tints and shadows of royal purple.\nPeaceful, coming out half an hour after with Baumberger at his\nheels, found him so and made a movement to sit down beside him.\nBut Peppajee rose and stalked majestically to the gate, then\nturned and confronted the two.\n”I talk yo’. Mebbyso no talk Man-with-big-belly.” He waited\nimpassively.\n”All right, Jim.” Peaceful turned apologetically toward his\nguest. ”Something he wants to tell me, Baumberger; kinda\nprivate, I guess. I’ll be back in a minute, anyway.”\n”Now don’t mind me at all,” Baumberger protested generously. ”Go\nahead just as if I wasn’t here–that’s what’ll please me best. I\nhope I ain’t so much of a stranger you’ve got to stand on\nceremony. Go on, and ﬁnd out what the old buck wants; he’s got\n57\nsomething on his mind, that’s sure. Been stealing fruit, maybe,\nand wants to square himself before you catch him at it.” He\nlaughed his laziest, and began leisurely to ﬁll his pipe.\nPeppajee led the way to the stable, where he stopped short and\nfaced Peaceful, his arms folded, one foot thrust forward in the\npose he aﬀected when about to speak of matters important.\n”Long time ago, when yo’ hair black,” he began deliberately, with\na sonorous lingering upon his vowels, ”yo’ all time my frien’. I\nyo’ frien’ all same. Yo’ no likum otha white man. Yo’ all time\nbueno. Yo’ house all same my wikiup. Me come eat at yo’ house,\ntalk yo’ all same brotha. Yo’ boys all same my boys–all time my\nfrien’. Me speakum all time no lie, mebbyso.”\n”No,” Peaceful assented unhesitatingly, ”you no tell lies,\nPeppajee. We good friends, many years.”\n”Huh! Man-that-catchum-ﬁsh, him no yo’ frien’. Shont-isham.\nAll time him speakum lies–tellum frien’ yo’, no frien’. Yo’ no\nmore tellum stop yo’ wikiup. Kay bueno. Yo’ thinkum frien’.\nAll time him have bad heart for yo’. Yo’ got ranch. Got plenty\nhay, plenty apple, plenty all thing for eat. All time him think\nbad for yo’. All time him likum steal yo’ ranch.”\nPeaceful laughed indulgently. ”You no sabe,” he explained. ”Him\nlike my ranch. Him say, long time ago, pay much money for my\nranch. Me no sell–me like for keep all time. Baumberger good\nman. Him no steal my ranch. Me got one paper from government\n–you sabe?–one paper say ranch all time b’longum me all same.\nBig white chief say ranch b’longum me all time. I die, ranch\nb’longum my boys. You sabe?”\nPeppajee considered. ”Me sabe,” he said at length. ”Me sabe\npaper, sabe ranch all time b’longum yo’. All same, him like for\nketchum yo’ ranch. Me hear much talk, him talk Man-that-coughs,\ntellum him ketchum ranch. Much white man come, so–” He lifted\none hand with thumb and ﬁngers outspread, made a downward\ngesture, and then raised three ﬁngers. ”Catchum ranch.”\nPeaceful shook his head while he smiled. ”No can do that.\nMebbyso much men come, heap ﬁght, mebbyso killum me, ranch all\nsame b’longum my boys. Men that ﬁghts go to jail, mebbyso\nhangum.” He indicated by signs his exact meaning.\nPeppajee scowled, and shook his head stubbornly. ”Me heap sabe.\nAll same, ketchum yo’ ranch. Man-that-catchum-ﬁsh kay bueno.\nYo’ thinkum frien’, yo’ damfool. Him all same rattlesnake.\nPlenty foolum yo’. Yo’ see. Yo’ thinkum Peppajee Jim heap big\nfool. Peaceful Hart, him all time one heap big damfool. Him\n58\nketchum yo’ ranch. Yo’ see.” He stopped and stared hard at the\ndim bulk of the grove, whence came the faint odor of smoke from\nBaumberger’s pipe.\n”Yo’ be smart man,” he added grimly, ”yo’ all same kickum dat\nmans oﬀ yo’ ranch.” For emphasis he thrust out a foot\nvigorously in the direction of the house and the man he maligned,\nand turned his face toward camp. Peaceful watched until the\nblanketed form merged into the dusk creeping over the valley, and\nwhen it disappeared ﬁnally into the short cut through the sage,\nhe shook his gray head in puzzlement over the absurd warning, and\nwent back to talk politics with Baumberger.\nCHAPTER X MIDNIGHT PROWLERS\nCame midnight and moonlight together, and with them came also\nGood Indian riding somewhat sullenly down the trail to the ranch.\nSullen because of Evadna’s attitude, which seemed to him\npermanently antagonistic, and for very slight cause, and which\nmade the ranch an unpleasant abiding place.\nHe decided that he would not stop at the ranch, but would go on\nup the valley to where one Abuer Hicks lived by himself in a\nhalf-dugout, half-board shack, and by mining a little where his\nland was untillable, and farming a little where the soil took\nkindly to fruit and grasses, managed to exist without too great\nhardship. The pension he received for having killed a few of his\nfellow-men at the behest of his government was devoted solely to\nliquid relief from the monotony of his life, and welcome indeed\nwas the man who brought him a bottle of joy between times.\nWherefore Good Indian had thoughtfully provided himself with a\nquart or so and rode with his mind at ease so far as his welcome\nat the Hicks dwelling place was concerned.\nOnce again the Peaceful Hart ranch lay in brooding silence under\nthe shadow of the bluﬀ. A few crickets chirped shrilly along\nthe trail, and from their sudden hush as he drew near marked\nunerringly his passing. Along the spring-fed creek the frogs\ncroaked a tuneless medley before him, and, like the crickets,\nstopped abruptly and waited in absolute silence to take up their\nnight chant again behind him. His horse stepped softly in the\ndeep sand of the trail, and, when he found that his rider refused\nto let him stop at the stable-door, shook his head in mute\ndispleasure, and went quietly on. As he neared the silent house,\nthe faint creak of saddle-leather and the rattle of spur-chains\nagainst his iron stirrups were smothered in the whispering of the\n59\ntreetops in the grove, so that only the quick hushing of night\nnoises alone betrayed him to any wakeful ear.\nHe was guilty of staring hard at that corner of the house where\nhe knew Evadna slept, and of scowling over the vague disquiet\nwhich the thought of her caused him. No girl had ever troubled\nhis mind before. It annoyed him that the face and voice of\nEvadna obtruded, even upon his thoughts of other things.\nThe grove was quiet, and he could hear Gene’s unmistakable snore\nover by the pond–the only sound save the whispering of the\ntrees, which went on, unmindful of his approach. It was evident,\nhe thought, that the ghost was eﬀectually laid–and on the heels\nof that, as he rode out from the deep shade of the grove and on\npast the garden to the meadows beyond, he wondered if, after all,\nit was again hardily wandering through the night; for he thought\nhe glimpsed a ﬁgure which ﬂitted behind a huge rock a few rods\nin advance of him, and his eyes were not used to playing him\ntricks.\nHe gave a twitch of his ﬁngers upon the reins, and turned from\nthe trail to investigate. He rode up to the rock, which stood\nlike an island of shade in that sea of soft moonlight, and,\npeering into the shadows, spoke a guarded challenge:\n”Who’s that?”\nA ﬁgure detached itself without sound from the blot of darkness\nthere, and stood almost at his stirrup.\n”Yo’ Good Injun–me likum for talk yo’.”\nGood Indian was conscious of a distinct disappointment, though he\nkept it from his voice when he answered:\n”Oh, it’s you, Peppajee. What you do here? Why you no sleepum\nyo’ wikiup?”\nPeppajee held up a slim, brown hand for silence, and afterward\nrested it upon the saddle-fork.\n”Yo’ heap frien’ Peaceful. Me heap frien’ all same. Mebbyso we\ntalk. Yo’ get down. No can see yo’, mebbyso; yo’ no likum bad\nman for se–” He stepped back a pace, and let Good Indian\ndismount; then with a gesture he led him back into the shadow of\nthe rock.\n”Well, what’s the row?” Good Indian asked impatiently, and\ncuriously as well.\n60\nPeppajee spoke more hastily than was usual. ”Me watchum\nMan-that-catchum-ﬁsh. Him hee-eeap kay bueno. Me no sabe why\nhim walk, walk in night–me heap watchum.”\n”You mean Baumberger? He’s all right. He comes down here to\ncatchum many ﬁsh–trout, up in the Malad, you sabe. Heap friend\nPeaceful. You no likum?”\n”Kay bueno.” Peppajee rested a foreﬁnger upon Good Indian’s\narm. ”Sun up there,” he pointed high in the west. ”Me go all\nsame Hartley. Come stable–Pete stable–me walkum close–no\nmakum noise. Me hear talk. Stoppum–no can see–me hear much\nbad talk. All time me hear, heap likum for steal dis ranch. Me\nno sabe”–his tone was doubtful for a space–”all same, me hear\nstealum this ranch. Man, you callum–”\n”Baumberger?” suggested Grant.\n”Him. All same Baumberga, him talk Man-that-coughs. All time\nsay stealum ranch. Makum much bad talk, them mans. Me come\nranch, me tellum Peaceful, him all time laugh, me. All time\nshakum head. Mebbyso thinkum I lie–shont-isham!”\n”What more you do?” Good Indian, at least, did not laugh.\n”Me go camp. Me thinkum, thinkum all time. Dat man have bad\nheart. Kay bueno. No can sleep–thinkum mebbyso do bad for\nPeaceful. Come ranch, stop all time dark, all time heap watchum.\nBimeby, mebbyso man–all same yo’ callum Baumberga–him come,\nlook, so–” He indicated, by a great craning of neck in all\ndirections, the wariness of one who goes by stealth. ”Him walk\nstill all time, go all time ova there.” He swept his arm toward\nthe meadows. ”Me go still, for watchum. Yo’ come, mebbyso make\nheap much noise–kay bueno. Dat mans, him hear, him heap scare.\nMe tellum, yo’ mebbyso go still.” He folded his arms with a\ngesture of ﬁnality, and stood statue-like in the deep gloom\nbeside the rock.\nGood Indian ﬁngered his horse’s mane while he considered the\nqueer story. There must be something in it, he thought, to bring\nPeppajee from his blankets at midnight and to impel him,\nunfriendly as he usually seemed, to conﬁde his worry to him at\nonce and without urging. And yet, to steal the Peaceful Hart\nranch–the idea was ludicrous. Still, there was no harm in\nlooking around a bit. He sought a sagebrush that suited his\npurpose, tied his horse to it, stooped, and took tho clanking\nMexican spurs from his heels, and touched Peppajee on the\nshoulder.\n”All right,” he murmured close to his ear, ”we go see.”\n61\nWithout a word, Peppajee turned, and stole away toward the\nmeadows, keeping always in the shadow of rock or bush,\nsilent-footed as a prowling bobcat. Close behind him, not quite\nso silent because of his riding-boots, which would strike now and\nthen upon a rock, however careful he was of his footing, went\nGood Indian.\nSo they circled the meadow, came into sand and sage beyond,\nsought there unavailingly, went on to the orchard, and skirted\nit, keen of eye and ear, struck quietly through it, and came at\nlast to the place where, the night before, Grant had overtaken\nEvadna–and it surprised him not a little to feel his heart\npounding unreasonably against his ribs when he stopped beside the\nrock where they had sat and quarreled.\nPeppajee looked back to see why Grant paused there, and then,\nwrapping his blanket tightly around him, crawled through the\nfence, and went on, keeping to the broad belt of shade cast upon\nthe ground by the row of poplars. Where the shade stopped\nabruptly, and beyond lay white moonlight with the ranch buildings\nblotching it here and there, he stopped and waited until Good\nIndian stood close beside him. Even then he did not speak, but,\nfreeing an arm slowly from the blanket folds, pointed toward the\nstable.\nGrant looked, saw nothing, stared harder, and so; feeling sure\nthere must be something hidden there, presently believed that a\nbit of the shadow at that end which was next the corral wavered,\nstopped, and then moved unmistakably. All the front of the\nstable was distinctly visible in the white light, and, while they\nlooked, something ﬂitted across it, and disappeared among the\nsage beyond the trail.\nAgain they waited; two minutes, three minutes, ﬁve. Then\nanother shadow detached itself slowly from the shade of the\nstable, hesitated, walked out boldly, and crossed the white sand\non the path to the house. Baumberger it was, and he stopped\nmidway to light his pipe, and so, puﬃng luxuriously, went on\ninto the blackness of the grove.\nThey heard him step softly upon the porch, heard also the bovine\nsigh with which he settled himself in the armchair there. They\ncaught the aromatic odor of tobacco smoke ascending, and knew\nthat his presence there had all at once become the most innocent,\nthe most natural thing in the world; for any man, waking on such\na night, needs no justiﬁcation for smoking a nocturnal pipe upon\nthe porch while he gazes dreamily out upon the moon-bathed world\naround him.\n62\nPeppajee touched Grant’s arm, and turned back, skirting the\npoplars again until they were well away from the house, and there\nwas no possibility of being heard. He stopped there, and\nconfronted the other.\n”What for you no stoppum stable?” he questioned bluntly. ”What\nfor you no stoppum ranch, for sleepum?”\n”I go for stoppum Hicks’ ranch,” said Good Indian, without any\nattempt at equivocation.\nPeppajee grunted.” What for yo’ no stoppum all same Peaceful?”\nGood Indian scorned a subterfuge, and spoke truly. ”That girl,\nEvadna, no likum me. All time mad me. So I no stoppum ranch, no\nmore.”\nPeppajee grinned brieﬂy and understandingly, and nodded his\nhead. ”Me heap sabe. Yo’ all time heap like for catchum that\ngirl, be yo’ squaw. Bimeby that girl heap likum yo’. Me sabe.”\nHe stood a moment staring at the stars peeping down from above\nthe rim-rock which guarded the bluﬀ. ”All same, yo’ no go\nstoppum Hicks,” he commanded. ”Yo’ stoppum dis ranch all time.\nYo’ all time watchum man–yo’ callum Baumberga.” He seemed to\nremember and speak the name with some diﬃculty. ”Where him go,\nyo’ go, for heap watchum. All time mebbyso me watchum\nMan-that-coughs. Me no sabe catchum ranch–all same, me watchum.\nThem mans heap kay bueno. Yo’ bet yo’ life!”\nA moment he stood there after he was through speaking, and then\nhe was not there. Good Indian did not hear him go, though he had\nstood beside him; neither could he, catching sight of a wavering\nshadow, say positively that there went Peppajee.\nHe waited for a space, stole back to where he could hear any\nsound from the porch even if he could not see, and when he was\ncertain that Baumberger had gone back to his bed, he got his\nhorse, took him by a roundabout way to the stable, and himself\nslept in a haystack. At least, he made himself a soft place\nbeside one, and lay there until the sun rose, and if he did not\nsleep it was not his fault, for he tried hard enough.\nThat is how Good Indian came to take his usual place at the\nbreakfast table, and to touch elbows with Evadna and to greet her\nwith punctilious politeness and nothing more. That is why he got\nout his ﬁshing-tackle and announced that he thought he would\nhave a try at some trout himself, and so left the ranch not much\nbehind Baumberger. That is why he patiently whipped the Malad\nriﬄes until he came up with the portly lawyer from Shoshone,\nand found him gleeful over a full basket and bubbling with\n63\ninnocent details of this gamy one and that one still gamier.\nThey rode home together, and together they spent the hot\nafternoon in the cool depths of the grove.\nBy sundown Good Indian was ready to call himself a fool and\nPeppajee Jim a meddlesome, visionary old idiot. Steal the\nPeaceful Hart ranch? The more he thought of it, the more\nridiculous the thing seemed.\nCHAPTER XI\n”YOU CAN’T PLAY WITH ME”\nGood Indian was young, which means that he was not always\nlogical, nor much given to looking very far into the future\nexcept as he was personally concerned in what he might see there.\nBy the time Sunday brought Miss Georgie Howard and the stir of\npreparation for the ﬁshing trip, he forgot that he had taken\nupon himself the responsibility of watching the obviously\nharmless movements of Baumberger, or had taken seriously the\nwarnings of Peppajee Jim; or if he did not forget, he at least\npushed it far into the background of his mind with the assertion\nthat Peppajee was a meddlesome old fool and Baumberger no more\ndesigning than he appeared–which was not at all.\nWhat did interest him that morning was the changeful mood of\nEvadna; though he kept his interest so well hidden that no one\nsuspected it–not even the young lady herself. It is possible\nthat if Evadna had known that Good Indian’s attitude of calm\noblivion to her moods was only a mask, she might have continued\nlonger her rigorous discipline of averted face and frigid tones.\nAs it was, she thawed toward him as he held himself more aloof,\nuntil she actually came to the point of addressing him directly,\nwith a ﬂicker of a smile for good measure; and, although he\nresponded with stiﬀ civility, he felt his blood pulse faster,\nand suddenly conceived the idea that women are like the creatures\nof the wild. If one is very quiet, and makes no advance\nwhatever, the hunted thing comes closer and closer, and then a\nsudden pounce–he caught his breath. After that he was wary and\nwatchful and full of his purpose.\nWithin ten minutes Evadna walked into the trap. They had\nstarted, and were ﬁfty yards up the trail, when Phoebe shouted\nfrantically after them. And because she was yet a timid rider\nand feared to keep the pace set by the others, it was Evadna who\n64\nheard and turned back to see what was the trouble. Aunt Phoebe\nwas standing beside the road, waving a ﬂask.\n”It’s the cream for your coﬀee,” she cried, going to meet\nEvadna. ”You can slip it into your jacket-pocket, can’t you,\nhoney? Huckleberry is so steady–and you won’t do any wild\nriding like the boys.”\n”I’ve got my veil and a box of bait and two handkerchiefs and a\npiece of soap,” the girl complained, reaching down for the\nbottle, nevertheless. ”But I can carry it in my hand till I\novertake somebody to give it to.”\nThe somebody proved to be Good Indian, who had found it necessary\nto stop and inspect carefully the left forefoot of his horse,\nwithout appearing aware of the girl’s approach. She ambled up at\nHuckleberry’s favorite shuﬄing gait, struck him with her\nwhip–a blow which would not have perturbed a mosquito–when he\nshowed a disposition to stop beside Grant, and then, when\nHuckleberry reluctantly resumed his pacing, pulled him up, and\nlooked back at the ﬁgure stooped over the hoof he held upon his\nknee. He was digging into the caked dirt inside the hoof with\nhis pocketknife, and, though Evadna waited while she might have\nspoken a dozen words, he paid not the slightest attention–and\nthat in spite of the distinct shadow of her head and shoulders\nwhich lay at his feet.\n”Oh–Grant,” she began perfunctorily, ”I’m sorry to trouble\nyou–but do you happen to have an empty pocket?”\nGood Indian gave a ﬁnal scrape with his knife, and released the\nfoot, which Keno immediately stamped pettishly into the dust. He\nclosed the knife, after wiping the blade upon his trousers leg,\nand returned it to his pocket before he so much as glanced toward\nher.\n”I may have. Why?” He picked up the bridle-reins, caught the\nsaddle-horn, and thrust his toe into the stirrup. From under his\nhat-brim he saw that she was pinching her under lip between her\nteeth, and the sight raised his spirits considerably.\n”Oh, nothing. Aunt Phoebe called me back, and gave me a bottle\nof cream, is all. I shall have to carry it in my hand, I\nsuppose.” She twitched her shoulders, and started Huckleberry\noﬀ again. She had called him Grant, instead of the formal Mr.\nImsen she had heretofore clung to, and he had not seemed to\nnotice it even.\nHe mounted with perfectly maddening deliberation, but for all\nthat he overtook her before she had gone farther than a few rods,\n65\nand he pulled up beside her with a decision which caused\nHuckleberry to stop also; Huckleberry, it must be confessed, was\nnever known to show any reluctance in that direction when his\nhead was turned away from home. He stood perfectly still while\nGood Indian reached out a hand.\n”I’ll carry it–I’m more used to packing bottles,” he announced\ngravely.\n”Oh, but if you must carry it in your hand, I wouldn’t dream\nof–” She was holding fast the bottle, and trying to wear her\nChristmas-angel look.\nGood Indian laid hold of the ﬂask, and they stood there\nstubbornly eying each other.\n”I thought you wanted me to carry it,” he said at last, pulling\nharder.\n”I merely asked if you had an empty pocket.” Evadna clung the\ntighter.\n”Now, what’s the use–”\n”Just what I was thinking!” Evadna was so impolite as to\ninterrupt him.\nGood Indian was not skilled in the management of women, but he\nknew horses, and to his decision he added an amendment.\nInstinctively he followed the method taught him by experience,\nand when he fancied he saw in her eyes a sign of weakening, he\nfollowed up the advantage he had gained.\n”Let go–because I’m going to have it anyway, now,” he said\nquietly, and took the ﬂask gently from her hands. Then he\nsmiled at her for yielding, and his smile was a revelation to the\ngirl, and brought the blood surging up to her face. She rode\nmeekly beside him at the pace he himself set–which was not\nrapid, by any means. He watched her with quick, sidelong\nglances, and wondered whether he would dare say what he wanted to\nsay–or at least a part of it.\nShe was gazing with a good deal of perseverance at the trail,\ndown the windings of which the others could be seen now and then\ngalloping through the dust, so that their progress was marked\nalways by a smothering cloud of gray. Then she looked at Grant\nunexpectedly, met one of his sharp glances, and ﬂushed hotly\nagain.\n”How about this business of hating each other, and not speaking\n66\nexcept to please Aunt Phoebe?” he demanded, with a suddenness\nwhich startled himself. He had been thinking it, but he hadn’t\nintended to say it until the words spoke themselves. ”Are we\nsupposed to keep on acting the fool indeﬁnitely?”\n”I was not aware that I, at least, was acting the fool,” she\nretorted, with a washed-out primness.\n”Oh, I can’t ﬁght the air, and I’m not going to try. What I’ve\ngot to say, I prefer to say straight from the shoulder. I’m sick\nof this standing oﬀ and giving each other the bad eye over\nnothing. If we’re going to stay on the same ranch, we might as\nwell be friends. What do you say?”\nFor a time he thought she was not going to say anything. She was\nstaring at the dust-cloud ahead, and chewing absently at the\ncorner of her under lip, and she kept it up so long that Good\nIndian began to scowl and call himself unseemly names for making\nany overture whatever. But, just as he turned toward her with\nlips half opened for a bitter sentence, he saw a dimple appear in\nthe cheek next to him, and held back the words.\n”You told me you didn’t like me,” she reminded, looking at him\nbrieﬂy, and afterward fumbling her reins. ”You can’t expect a\ngirl–”\n”I suppose you don’t remember coming up to me that ﬁrst night,\nand calling me names, and telling me how you hated me, and–and\nwinding up by pinching me?” he insinuated with hypocritical\nreproach, and felt of his arm. ”If you could see the mark–” he\nhinted shamelessly.\nEvadna replied by pushing up her sleeve and displaying a scratch\nat least an inch in length, and still roughened and red. ”I\nsuppose you don’t remember trying to MURDER me?” she inquired,\nsweetly triumphant. ”If you could shoot as well as Jack, I’d\nhave been killed very likely. And you’d be in jail this minute,”\nshe added, with virtuous solemnity.\n”But you’re not killed, and I’m not in jail.”\n”And I haven’t told a living soul about it–not even Aunt\nPhoebe,” Evadna remarked, still painfully virtuous. ”If I had–”\n”She’d have wondered, maybe, what you were doing away down there\nin the middle of the night,” Good Indian ﬁnished. ”I didn’t\ntell a soul, either, for that matter.”\nThey left the meadowland and the broad stretch of barren sand and\nsage, and followed, at a leisurely pace, the winding of the trail\n67\nthrough the scarred desolation where the earth had been washed\nfor gold. Evadna stared absently at the network of deep gashes,\nevidently meditating very seriously. Finally she turned to\nGrant with an honest impulse of friendliness.\n”Well, I’m sure I’m willing to bury the tomahawk–er–that is, I\nmean–” She blushed hotly at the slip, and stammered\nincoherently.\n”Never mind.” His eyes laughed at her confusion. ”I’m not as\nbad as all that; it doesn’t hurt my feelings to have tomahawks\nmentioned in my presence.”\nHer cheeks grew redder, if that were possible, but she made no\nattempt to ﬁnish what she had started to say.\nGood Indian rode silent, watching her unobtrusively and wishing\nhe knew how to bring the conversation by the most undeviating\npath to a certain much-desired conclusion. After all, she was\nnot a wild thing, but a human being, and he hesitated. In\ndealing with men, he had but one method, which was to go straight\nto the point regardless of consequences. So he half turned in\nthe saddle and rode with one foot free of the stirrup that he\nmight face her squarely.\n”You say you’re willing to bury the tomahawk; do you mean it?”\nHis eyes sought hers, and when they met her glance held it in\nspite of her blushes, which indeed puzzled him. But she did not\nanswer immediately, and so he repeated the question.\n”Do you mean that? We’ve been digging into each other pretty\nindustriously, and saying how we hate each other–but are you\nwilling to drop it and be friends? It’s for you to say–and\nyou’ve got to say it now.”\nEvadna hung up her head at that. ”Are you in the habit of laying\ndown the law to everyone who will permit it?” she evaded.\n”Am I to take it for granted you meant what you said?” He stuck\nstubbornly to the main issue. ”Girls seem to have a way of\nsaying things, whether they mean anything or not. Did you?”\n”Did I what?” She was wide-eyed innocence again.\nGood Indian muttered something profane, and kicked his horse in\nthe ribs. When it had taken no more than two leaps forward,\nhowever, he pulled it down to a walk again, and his eyes boded\nill for the misguided person who goaded him further. He glanced\nat the girl sharply.\n68\n”This thing has got to be settled right now, without any more\nfooling or beating about the bush,” he said–and he said it so\nquietly that she could scarcely be blamed for not realizing what\nlay beneath. She was beginning to recover her spirits and her\ncomposure, and her whole attitude had become demurely impish.\n”Settle it then, why don’t you?” she taunted sweetly. ”I’m sure\nI haven’t the faintest idea what there is to settle–in that\nsolemn manner. I only know we’re a mile behind the others, and\nMiss Georgie will be wondering–”\n”You say I’m to settle it, the way I want it settled?”\nIf Evadna did not intend anything serious, she certainly was a\nfool not to read aright his ominously calm tone and his tensely\nquiet manner. She must have had some experience in coquetry, but\nit is very likely that she had never met a man just like this\none. At all events, she tilted her blonde head, smiled at him\ndaringly, and then made a little grimace meant to signify her\ndeﬁance of him and his unwarranted earnestness.\nGood Indian leaned unexpectedly, caught her in his arms, and\nkissed her three times upon her teasing, smiling mouth, and while\nshe was gasping for words to voice her amazement he drew back his\nhead, and gazed sternly into her frightened eyes.\n”You can’t play with ME,” he muttered savagely, and kissed her\nagain. ”This is how I settle it. You’ve made me want you for\nmine. It’s got to be love or–hate now. There isn’t anything\nbetween, for me and you.” His eyes passed hungrily from her\nquivering lips to her eyes, and the glow within his own made her\nbreath come faster. She struggled weakly to free herself, and\nhis clasp only tightened jealously.\n”If you had hated me, you wouldn’t have stopped back there, and\nspoken to me,” he said, the words coming in a rush. ”Women like\nto play with love, I think. But you can’t play with me. I want\nyou. And I’m going to have you. Unless you hate me. But you\ndon’t. I’d stake my life on it.” And he kissed her again.\nEvadna reached up, felt for her hat, and began pulling it\nstraight, and Good Indian, recalled to himself by the action,\nreleased her with manifest reluctance. He felt then that he\nought never to let her go out of his arms; it was the only way,\nit seemed to him, that he could be sure of her. Evadna found\nwords to express her thoughts, and her thoughts were as wholly\nconventional as was the impulse to straighten her hat.\n”We’ve only known each other a week!” she cried tremulously,\nwhile her gloved ﬁngers felt inquiringly for loosened hairpins.\n69\n”You’ve no right–you’re perfectly horrid! You take everything\nfor granted–”\nGood Indian laughed at her, a laugh of pure, elemental joy in\nlife and in love.\n”A man’s heart does not beat by the calendar. Nature made the\nheart to beat with love, ages before man measured time, and\nprattled of hours and days and weeks,” he retorted. ”I’m not the\nsame man I was a week ago. Nor an hour ago. What does it matter\nI am–the man I am NOW.” He looked at her more calmly. ”An\nhour ago,” he pointed out, ”I didn’t dream I should kiss you.\nNor you, that you would let me do it.”\n”I didn’t! I couldn’t help myself. You–oh, I never saw such\na–a brute!” The tears in her eyes were, perhaps, tears of rage\nat the swiftness with which he had mastered the situation and\nturned it in a breath from the safe channel of petty argument.\nShe struck Huckleberry a blow with her whip which sent that\nastonished animal galloping down the slope before them, his ears\nlaid back and his white eyelashes blinking resentment against the\noutrage.\nGood Indian laughed aloud, spurred Keno into a run, and passed\nher with a scurry of dust, a ﬂash of white teeth and laughing\nblack eyes, and a wave of his free hand in adieu. He was still\nlaughing when he overtook the others, passed by the main group,\nand singled out Jack, his particular chum. He refused to explain\neither his hurry or his mirth further than to ﬂing out a vague\nsentence about a race, and thereafter he ambled contentedly along\nbeside Jack in the lead, and told how he had won a hundred and\nsixty dollars in a crap game the last time he was in Shoshone,\nand how he had kept on until he had ”quit ten dollars in the\nhole.” The rest of the boys, catching a few words here and\nthere, crowded close, and left the two girls to themselves, while\nGood Indian recounted in detail the ﬂuctuations of the game;\nhow he had seesawed for an hour, winning and losing alternately;\nand how his luck had changed suddenly just when he had made up\nhis mind to play a ﬁve-dollar gold piece he had in his hand and\nquit.\n”I threw naturals three times in succession,” he said, ”and let\nmy bets ride. Then I got Big Dick, made good, and threw another\nnatural. I was seeing those Spanish spurs and that peach of a\nheadstall in Fernando’s by that time; seeing them on Keno and\nme–they’re in the window yet, Jack, and I went in when I ﬁrst\nhit town and looked them over and priced them; a hundred and\nﬁfty, just about what we guessed he’d hold them at. And say,\nthose conchos–you remember the size of ’em, Jack?–they’re solid\nsilver, hammered out and engraved by hand. Those Mexicans sure\n70\ndo turn out some ﬁne work on their silver ﬁxings!” He felt in\nhis pocket for a match.\n”Pity I didn’t let well enough alone,” he went on. ”I had the\nprice of the outﬁt, and ten dollars over. But then I got\nhoggish. I thought I stood a good chance of making seven lucky\npasses straight–I did once, and I never got over it, I guess. I\nwas going to pinch down to ten–but I didn’t; I let her ride.\nAnd SHOT CRAPS!”\nHe drew the match along the stamped saddle-skirt behind the\ncantle, because that gave him a chance to steal a look behind him\nwithout being caught in the act. Good, wide hat-brims have more\nuses than to shield one’s face from the sun. He saw that Evadna\nwas riding in what looked like a sulky silence beside her friend,\nbut he felt no compunction for what he had done; instead he was\nexhilarated as with some heady wine, and he did not want to do\nany thinking about it–yet. He did not even want to be near\nEvadna. He faced to the front, and lighted his cigarette while\nhe listened to the sympathetic chorus from the boys.\n”What did you do then?” asked Gene.\n”Well, I’d lost the whole blamed chunk on a pair of measly aces,”\nhe said. ”I was pretty sore by that time, I’m telling you! I was\ndown to ten dollars, but I started right in to bring back that\nhundred and sixty. Funny, but I felt exactly as if somebody had\nstolen that headstall and spurs right out of my hand, and I just\nhad to get it back pronto. I started in with a dollar, lost it\non craps–sixes, that time–sent another one down the same trail\ntrying to make Little Joe come again, third went on craps, fourth\nI doubled on nine, lost ’em both on craps–say, I never looked so\nmany aces and sixes in the face in my life! It was sure kay\nbueno, the luck I had that night. I got up broke, and had to\nstrike Riley for money to get out of town with.”\nSo for a time he managed to avoid facing squarely this new and\nvery important factor which must henceforth have its place in the\nproblem of his life.\nCHAPTER XII\n”THEM DAMN SNAKE”\nThree hundred yards up the river, in the shade of a huge bowlder,\nround an end of which the water hurried in a green swirl that it\n71\nmight the sooner lie quiet in the deep, dark pool below, Good\nIndian, picking his solitary way over the loose rocks, came\nunexpectedly upon Baumberger, his heavy pipe sagging a corner of\nhis ﬂabby mouth, while he painstakingly detached a ﬂy from his\nleader, hooked it into the proper compartment of his ﬂy-book,\nand hesitated over his selection of another to take its place.\nAbsorption was writ deep on his gross countenance, and he\nrecognized the intruder by the briefest of ﬂickering glances and\nthe slightest of nods.\n”Keep back from that hole, will yuh?” he muttered, jerking his\nhead toward the still pool. ”I ain’t tried it yet.”\nGood Indian was not particularly interested in his own ﬁshing.\nThe sight of Baumberger, bulking there in the shade with his\nsagging cheeks and sagging pipe, his ﬂopping old hat and baggy\ncanvas ﬁshing-coat, with his battered basket slung over his\nslouching shoulder and sagging with the weight of his catch; the\nsloppy wrinkles of his high, rubber boots shining blackly from\nrecent immersion in the stream, caught his errant attention, and\nstayed him for a few minutes to watch.\nLoosely disreputable looked Lawyer Baumberger, from the snagged\nhole in his hat-crown where a wisp of graying hair ﬂuttered\nthrough, to the toes of his ungainly, rubber-clad feet; loosely\ndisreputable, but not commonplace and not incompetent. Though\nhis speech might be a slovenly mumble, there was no purposeless\nfumbling of the ﬁngers that chose a ﬂy and knotted it fast upon\nthe leader. There was no bungling movement of hand or foot when\nhe laid his pipe upon the rock, tiptoed around the corner, sent a\nmechanical glance upward toward the swaying branches of an\noverhanging tree, pulled out his six feet of silk line with a\nsweep of his arm, and with a delicate ﬁllip, sent the ﬂy\nskittering over the glassy center of the pool.\nGood Indian, looking at him, felt instinctively that a part, at\nleast, of the man’s nature was nakedly revealed to him then. It\nseemed scarcely fair to read the lust of him and the utter\nabandonment to the hazard of the game. Pitiless he looked, with\nclenched teeth just showing between the loose lips drawn back in\na grin that was half-snarl, half-involuntary contraction of\nmuscles sympathetically tense.\nThat was when a shimmering thing slithered up, snapped at the\nﬂy, and ﬂashed away to the tune of singing reel and the dance\nof the swaying rod. The man grew suddenly cruel and crafty and\nfull of lust; and Good Indian, watching him, was conscious of an\ninward shudder of repulsion. He had ﬁshed all his life–had\nGood Indian–and had found joy in the sport. And here was he\ninwardly condemning a sportsman who stood self-revealed,\n72\nrepelling, hateful; a man who gloated over the struggle of\nsomething alive and at his mercy; to whom sport meant power\nindulged with impunity. Good Indian did not try to put the thing\nin words, but he felt it nevertheless.\n”Brute!” he muttered aloud, his face eloquent of cold disgust.\nAt that moment Baumberger drew the tired ﬁsh gently into the\nshallows, swung him deftly upon the rocks, and laid hold of him\ngreedily.\n”Ain’t he a beaut?” he cried, in his wheezy chuckle. ”Wait a\nminute while I weigh him. He’ll go over a pound, I’ll bet money\non it.” Gloatingly he held it in his hands, removed the hook,\nand inserted under the gills the larger one of the little scales\nhe carried inside his basket.\n”Pound and four ounces,” he announced, and slid the ﬁsh into his\nbasket. He was the ordinary, good-natured, gross Baumberger now.\nHo reached for his pipe, placed it in his mouth, and held out a\nhand to Good Indian for a match.\n”Say, young fella, have you got any stand-in with your noble red\nbrothers?” he asked, after he had sucked life into the charred\ntobacco.\n”Cousins twice or three times removed, you mean,” said Good\nIndian coldly, too proud and too lately repelled to meet the man\non friendly ground. ”Why do you ask?”\nBaumberger eyed him speculatively while he smoked, and chuckled\nto himself.\n”One of ’em–never mind placing him on his own p’ticular limb of\nthe family tree–has been doggin’ me all morning,” he said at\nlast, and waved a ﬁshy hand toward the bluﬀ which towered high\nabove them. ”Saw him when I was comin’ up, about sunrise, pokin’\nalong behind me in the sagebrush. Didn’t think anything of\nthat–thought maybe he was hunting or going ﬁshing–but he’s\nbeen sneakin’ around behind me ever since. I don’t reckon he’s\nafter my scalp–not enough hair to pay–but I’d like to know what\nthe dickens he does mean.”\n”Nothing probably,” Good Indian told him shortly, his eyes\nnevertheless searching the rocks for a sight of the watcher.\n”Well, I don’t much like the idea,” complained Baumberger,\ncasting an eye aloft in fear of snagging his line when he made\nanother cast. ”He was right up there a few minutes ago.” He\npointed his rod toward a sun-ridden ridge above them. ”I got a\n73\nﬂicker of his green blanket when he raised up and scowled down\nat me. He ducked when he saw me turn my head–looked to me like\nthe surly buck that blew in to the ranch the night I came; Jim\nsomething-or-other. By the great immortal Jehosaphat!” he swore\nhumorously, ”I’d like to tie him up in his dirty blanket and\nheave him into the river–only it would kill all the ﬁsh in the\nMalad.”\nGood Indian laughed.\n”Oh, I know it’s funny, young fella,” Baumberger growled. ”About\nas funny as being pestered by a mosquito buzzing under your nose\nwhen you’re playing a ﬁsh that keeps cuttin’ ﬁgure eights in a\nhole the size uh that one there.”\n”I’ll go up and take a look,” Good Indian oﬀered carelessly.\n”Well, I wish you would. I can’t keep my mind on m’\nﬁshing–just wondering what the deuce he’s after. And say! You\ntell him I’ll stand him on his oﬀ ear if I catch him doggie’ me\nag’in. Folks come with yuh?” he remembered to ask as he prepared\nfor another cast into the pool.\n”They’re down there getting a campﬁre built, ready to fry what\nﬁsh they catch,” Good Indian informed him, as he turned to climb\nthe bluﬀ. ”They’re going to eat dinner under that big ledge by\nthe rapids. You better go on down.”\nHe stood for a minute, and watched Baumberger make a dexterous\ncast, which proved fruitless, before he began climbing up the\nsteep slope of jumbled bowlders upon which the bluﬀ itself\nseemed to rest. He was not particularly interested in his quest,\nbut he was in the mood for purposeless action; he still did not\nwant to think.\nHe climbed negligently, scattering loose rocks down the hill\nbehind him. He had no expectation of coming upon\nPeppajee–unless Peppajee deliberately put himself in his\nway–and so there was no need of caution. He stopped once, and\nstood long minutes with his head turned to catch the faint sound\nof high-keyed laughter and talk which drifted up to him. If he\nwent higher, he thought, he might get a glimpse of them–of her,\nto tell his thought honestly. Whereupon he forgot all about\nﬁnding and expostulating with Peppajee, and thought only a point\nof the ridge which would give him a clear view downstream.\nTo be sure, he might as easily have retraced his steps and joined\nthe group, and seen every changing look in her face. But he did\nnot want to be near her when others were by; he wanted her to\nhimself, or not at all. So he went on, while the sun beat hotly\n74\ndown upon him and the rocks sent up dry waves of heat like an\noven.\nA rattlesnake buzzed its strident warning between two rocks, but\nbefore he turned his attention to the business of killing it, the\nsnake had crawled leisurely away into a cleft, where he could not\nreach it with the stones he threw. His thoughts, however, were\nbrought back to his surroundings so that he remembered Peppajee.\nHe stood still, and scanned carefully the jumble of rocks and\nbowlders which sloped steeply down to the river, looking for a\nbetraying bit of color or dirty gray hat-crown.\n”But I could look my eyes out and welcome, if he didn’t want to\nbe seen,” he concluded, and sat down while he rolled a cigarette.\n”And I don’t know as I want to see him, anyway.” Still, he did\nnot move immediately. He was in the shade, which was a matter\nfor congratulation on such a day. He had a cigarette between his\nlips, which made for comfort; and he still felt the exhilarating\neﬀects of his unpremeditated boldness, without having come to\nthe point of sober thinking. He sat there, and blew occasional\nmouthfuls of smoke into the quivering heat waves, and stared down\nat the river rushing over the impeding rocks as if its very\nexistence depended upon reaching as soon as possible the broader\nsweep of the Snake.\nHe ﬁnished the ﬁrst cigarette, and rolled another from sheer\nforce of habit rather than because he really wanted one. He\nlifted one foot, and laid it across his knee, and was drawing a\nmatch along the sole of his boot when his eyes chanced to rest\nfor a moment upon a ﬂutter of green, which showed brieﬂy around\nthe corner of a great square rock poised insecurely upon one\ncorner, as if it were about to hurl its great bulk down upon the\nriver it had watched so long. He held the blazing match poised\nmidway to its destination while he looked; then he put it to the\nuse he had meant it for, pulled his hat-brim down over his right\neye and ear to shield them from the burn of the sun, and went\npicking his way idly over to the place.\n”HUL-lo!” he greeted, in the manner of one who refuses to\nacknowledge the seriousness of a situation which confronts him\nsuddenly. ”What’s the excitement?”\nThere was no excitement whatever. There was Peppajee, hunched up\nagainst the rock in that uncomfortable attitude which permits a\nman to come at the most intimate relations with the outside of\nhis own ankle, upon which he was scowling in seeming malignity.\nThere was his hunting-knife lying upon a ﬂat stone near to his\nhand, with a fresh red blotch upon the blade, and there was his\nlittle stone pipe clenched between his teeth and glowing red\nwithin the bowl. Also there was the ankle, purple and swollen\n75\nfrom the ligature above it–for his legging was oﬀ and torn into\nstrips which formed a bandage, and a splinter of rock was twisted\ningeniously in the wrappings for added tightness. From a\ncrisscross of gashes a sluggish, red stream trickled down to the\nankle-bone, and from there drip-dropped into a tiny, red pool in\nthe barren, yellow soil.\n”Catchum rattlesnake bite?” queried Good Indian inanely, as is\nthe habit of the onlooker when the scene shouts forth eloquently\nits explanation, and questions are almost insultingly\nsuperﬂuous.\n”Huh!” grunted Peppajee, disdaining further speech upon the\nsubject, and regarded sourly the red drip.\n”Want me to suck it?” ventured Good Indian unenthusiastically,\neying the wound.\n”Huh!” Peppajee removed the pipe, his eyes still upon his ankle.\n”Plenty blood come, mebbyso.” To make sure, however, he kneaded\nthe swollen ﬂesh about the wound, thus accelerating slightly\nthe red drip.\nThen deliberately he took another turn with the rock, sending the\nbuckskin thongs deeper into the ﬂesh, and held the burning pipe\nagainst the skin above the wound until Good Indian sickened and\nturned away his head. When he looked again, Peppajee was sucking\nhard at the pipe, and gazing impersonally at the place. He bent\nagain, and hid the glow of his pipe against his ankle. His thin\nlips tightened while he held it there, but the lean, brown\nﬁngers were ﬁrm as splinters of the rock behind him. When the\nﬁre cooled, he fanned it to life again with his breath, and when\nit winked redly at him he laid it grimly against his ﬂesh.\nSo, while Good Indian stood and looked on with lips as tightly\ndrawn as the other’s, he seared a circle around the wound–a\ncircle which bit deep and drew apart the gashes like lips opened\nfor protest. He regarded critically his handiwork, muttered a\n”Bueno” under his breath, knocked the ashes from his pipe, and\nreturned it to some mysterious hiding-place beneath his blanket.\nThen he picked up his moccasin.\n”Them damn’ snake, him no speakum,” he observed disgustedly.\n”Heap fool me; him biteum”–he made a stabbing gesture with thumb\nand ﬁnger in the air by way of illustration–”then him go\nquick.” He began gingerly trying to force the moccasin upon his\nfoot, his mouth drawn down with the look of one who considers\nthat he has been hardly used.\n”How you get home?” Good Indian’s thoughts swung round to\n76\npractical things. ”You got horse?”\nPeppajee shook his head, reached for his knife, and slit the\nmoccasin till it was no more than a wrapping. ”Mebbyso heap\nwalk,” he stated simply.\n”Mebbyso you won’t do anything of the kind,” Good Indian\nretorted. ”You come down and take a horse. What for you all\ntime watchum Baumberger?” he added, remembering then what had\nbrought them both upon the bluﬀ. ”Baumberger all time ﬁsh–no\nmore.” He waved his hand toward the Malad. ”Baumberger\nbueno–catchum ﬁsh–no more.”\nPeppajee got slowly and painfully upon his feet–rather, upon one\nfoot. When Good Indian held out a steadying arm, he accepted it,\nand leaned rather heavily.\n”Yo’ eyes sick,” said Peppajee, and grinned sardonically. ”Yo’\neyes see all time Squaw-with-sun-hair. Fillum yo’ eyes, yo’ see\nnotting. Yo’ catchum squaw, bimeby mebbyso see plenty mo’. Me\nno catchum sick eye. Mebbyso me see heap plenty.”\n”What you see, you all time watchum Baumberger?”\nBut Peppajee, hobbling where he must walk, crawling where he\nmight, sliding carefully where a slanting bowlder oﬀered a few\nfeet of smooth descent, and taking hold of Good Indian’s oﬀered\narm when necessity impelled him, pressed his thin lips together,\nand refused to answer. So they came at last to the ledge beside\nthe rapids, where a thin wisp of smoke waved lazily in the\nvagrant breeze which played with the ripples and swayed languidly\nthe smaller branches of the nearby trees.\nOnly Donny was there, sitting disgruntled upon the most\ncomfortable rock he could ﬁnd, sulking because the others had\ntaken all the ﬁshing-tackle that was of any account, and had\nleft him to make shift with one bent, dulled hook, a lump of fat\npork, and a dozen feet of line.\n”And I can catch more ﬁsh than anybody in the bunch!” he began\ncomplainingly and without preface, waving a dirty hand\ncontemptuously at the despised tackle when the two came slowly\nup. ”That’s the way it goes when you take a lot of girls along!\nThey’ve got to have the best rods and tackle, and all they’ll do\nwill be to snag lines and lose leaders and hooks, and giggle alla\nsqueal. Aw–DARN girls!”\n”And I’m going to pile it on still thicker, Donny!” Good Indian\ngrinned down at him. ”I’m going to swipe your Pirate Chief for a\nwhile, till I take Peppajee into camp. He’s gentle, and\n77\nPeppajee’s got a snake-bite. I’ll be back before you get ready\nto go home.”\n”I’m ready to go home right now,” growled Donny, sinking his chin\nbetween his two palms. ”But I guess the walkin’ ain’t all taken\nup.”\nGood Indian regarded him frowningly, gave a little snort, and\nturned away. Donny in that mood was not to be easily placated,\nand certainly not to be ignored. He went over to the little\nﬂat, and selected Jack’s horse, saddled him, and discovered that\nit had certain well-deﬁned race prejudices, and would not let\nPeppajee put foot to the stirrup. Keno he knew would be no more\ntractable, so that he ﬁnally slapped Jack’s saddle on\nHuckleberry, and so got Peppajee mounted and headed toward camp.\n”You tell Jack I borrowed his saddle and Huckleberry,” he called\nout to the drooping little ﬁgure on the rock. ”But I’ll get\nback before they want to go home.”\nBut Donny was glooming over his wrongs, and neither heard nor\nwanted to hear. Having for his legacy a temper cumulative in its\nheat, he was coming rapidly to the point where he, too, started\nhome, and left no word or message behind; a trivial enough\nincident in itself, but one which opened the way for some\nmisunderstanding and fruitless speculation upon the part of\nEvadna.\nCHAPTER XIII\nCLOUD-SIGN VERSUS CUPID\nFew men are ever called upon by untoward circumstance to know the\nsensations caused by rattlesnake bite, knife gashes, impromptu\ncauterization, and, topping the whole, the peculiar torture of\ncongested veins and swollen muscles which comes from a\ntourniquet. The feeling must be unpleasant in the extreme, and\nthe most morbid of sensation-seekers would scarcely put himself\nin the way of that particular experience.\nPeppajee Jim, therefore, had reason in plenty for glowering at\nthe world as he saw it that day. He held Huckleberry rigidly\ndown to his laziest amble that the jar of riding might be\nlessened, kept his injured foot free from the stirrup, and merely\ngrunted when Good Indian asked him once how he felt.\n78\nWhen they reached the desolation of the old placer-pits, however,\nhe turned his eyes from the trail where it showed just over\nHuckleberry’s ears, and regarded sourly the deep gashes and\ndislodged bowlders which told where water and the greed of man\nfor gold had raged ﬁercest. Then, for the ﬁrst time during the\nwhole ride, he spoke.\n”All time, yo’ sleepum,” he said, in the sonorous, oracular tone\nwhich he usually employed when a subject held his serious\nthought. ”Peaceful Hart, him all same sleepum. All same sleepum\n’longside snake. No seeum snake, no thinkum mebbyso catchum\nbite.” He glanced down at his own snake-bitten foot. ”Snake\nbite, make all time much hurt.” His eyes turned, and dwelt\nsharply upon the face of Good Indian.\n”Yo’ all time thinkum Squaw-with-sun-hair. Me tell yo’ for\nwatchum, yo’ no think for watchum. Baumberga, him all same\nsnake. Yo’ think him all time catchum ﬁsh. HUH! Yo’ heap big\nfool, yo’ thinkum cat. Rattlesnake, mebbyso sleepum in sun one\ntime. Yo’ no thinkum bueno, yo’ seeum sleep in sun. Yo’ heap\nsabe him all time kay bueno jus’ same. Yo’ heap sabe yo’ come\nclose, him biteum. Mebbyso biteum hard, for killum yo’ all\ntime.” He paused, then drove home his point like the true\norator. ”Baumberga catchum ﬁsh. All same rattlesnake sleepum\nin sun. Kay bueno.”\nGood Indian jerked his mind back from delicious recollection of\none sweet, swift-passing minute, and half opened his lips for\nreply. But he did not speak; he did not know what to say, and it\nis ill-spent time–that passed in purposeless speech with such as\nPeppajee. Peppajee roused himself from meditation brief as it\nseemed deep, lifted a lean, brown hand to push back from his eyes\na fallen lock of hair, and pointed straight away to the west.\n”Las’ night, sun go sleepum. Clouds come all same blanket, sun\nwrappum in blanket. Cloud look heap mad–mebbyso make much\nstorm. Bimeby much mens come in cloud, stand so–and so–and\nso.” With pointing ﬁnger he indicated a half circle. ”Otha man\ncome, heap big man. Stoppum ’way oﬀ, all time makeum sign, for\nﬁght. Me watchum. Me set by ﬁre, watchum cloud makeum sign.\nFire smoke look up for say, ’What yo’ do all time, mebbyso?’\nCloud man shakeum hand, makeum much sign. Fire smoke heap sad,\nbend down far, lookum me, lookum where cloud look. All time\nlookum for Peaceful Hart ranch. Me lay down for sleepum, me\ndream all time much ﬁght. All time bad sign come. Kay bueno.”\nPeppajee shook his head slowly, his leathery face set in deep,\nsomber lines.\n”Much trouble come heap quick,” he said gravely, hitching his\nblanket into place upon his shoulder. ”Me no sabe–all same,\n79\nheap trouble come. Much mens, mebbyso much ﬁght, much\nshootum–mebbyso kill. Peaceful Hart him all time laugh me. All\nsame, me sabe smoke sign, sabe cloud sign, sabe–Baumberga. Heap\nka-a-ay bueno!”\nGood Indian’s memory dashed upon him a picture of bright\nmoonlight and the broody silence of a night half gone, and of a\nﬁgure forming sharply and suddenly from the black shadow of the\nstable and stealing away into the sage, and of Baumberger\nemerging warily from that same shadow and stopping to light his\npipe before he strolled on to the house and to the armchair upon\nthe porch.\nThere might be a sinister meaning in that picture, but it was so\nwell hidden that he had little hope of ever ﬁnding it. Also, it\noccurred to him that Peppajee, usually given over to creature\ncomforts and the idle gossip of camp and the ranches he visited,\nwas proving the sincerity of his manifest uneasiness by a\nwatchfulness wholly at variance with his natural laziness. On\nthe other hand, Peppajee loved to play the oracle, and a waving\nwisp of smoke, or the changing shapes in a wind-riven cloud meant\nto him spirit-sent prophecies not to be ignored.\nHe turned the matter over in his mind, was the victim of\nuneasiness for ﬁve minutes, perhaps, and then drifted oﬀ into\nwondering what Evadna was doing at that particular moment, and to\nplanning how he should manage to fall behind with her when they\nall rode home, and so make possible other delicious moments. He\neven took note of certain sharp bends in the trail, where a\ncouple riding ﬁfty yards, say, behind a group would be for the\ntime being quite hidden from sight and to all intents and\npurposes alone in the world for two minutes, or three–perhaps\nthe time might be stretched to ﬁve.\nThe ranch was quiet, with even the dogs asleep in the shade.\nPeppajee insisted in one sentence upon going straight on to camp,\nso they did not stop. Without speaking, they plodded through the\ndust up the grade, left it, and followed the dim trail through\nthe sagebrush and rocks to the Indian camp which seemed asleep\nalso, except where three squaws were squatting in the sharply\ndeﬁned, conical shadow of a wikiup, mumbling desultorily the\ngossip of their little world, while their ﬁngers moved with\nmechanical industry–one shining black head bent over a\nhalf-ﬁnished, beaded moccasin, another stitching a crude gown of\nbright-ﬂowered calico, and the third braiding her hair afresh\nwith leisurely care for its perfect smoothness. Good Indian took\nnote of the group before it stirred to activity, and murmured\nanxiety over the bandaged foot of Peppajee.\n”Me no can watchum more, mebbyso six days. Yo’ no sleepum all\n80\ntime yo’ walk–no thinkum all time squaw. Mebbyso yo’ think for\nman-snake. Mebbyso yo’ watchum,” Peppajee said, as he swung\nslowly down from Huckleberry’s back.\n”All right. I’ll watchum plenty,” Good Indian promised lightly,\ngave a glance of passing, masculine interest at the squaw who was\nbraiding her hair, and who was young and fresh-cheeked and\nbright-eyed and slender, forgot her the instant his eyes left\nher, and made haste to return to the Malad and the girl who held\nall his thoughts and all his desire.\nThat girl was sitting upon the rock which Donny had occupied, and\nshe looked very much as if she were sulking, much as Donny had\nsulked. She had her chin in a pink palm and was digging little\nholes in the sand with the tip of her rod, which was not at all\nbeneﬁcial to the rod and did not appear even to interest the\ndigger; for her wonderfully blue eyes were staring at the\ngreen-and-white churn of the rapids, and her lips were pursed\nmoodily, as if she did not even see what she was looking at so\nﬁxedly.\nGood Indian’s eyes were upon her while he was dismounting, but he\ndid not go to her immediately. Instead, he busied himself with\nunsaddling, and explained to the boys just why he had left so\nunaccountably. Secretly he was hoping that Evadna heard the\nexplanation, and he raised his voice purposely. But Evadna was\nnot listening, apparently; and, if she had been, the noise of the\nrapids would have prevented her hearing what he said.\nMiss Georgie Howard was frying ﬁsh and consistently snubbing\nBaumberger, who hulked loosely near the campﬁre, and between\npuﬀs at his pipe praised heavily her skill, and professed to own\na ravenous appetite. Good Indian heard him as he passed close by\nthem, and heard also the keen thrust she gave in return; and he\nstopped and half turned, looking at her with involuntary\nappreciation. His glance took in Baumberger next, and he lifted\na shoulder and went on. Without intentionally resorting to\nsubterfuge, he felt an urge to wash his hands, and he chose for\nhis ablutions that part of the river’s edge which was nearest\nEvadna.\nFirst he stooped and drank thirstily, his hat pushed back, while\nhis lips met full the hurrying water, clear and cold, yet with\nthe chill it had brought from the mountain springs which fed it,\nand as he lifted his head he looked full at her.\nEvadna stared stonily over him to where the water boiled fastest.\nHe might have been one of the rocks, for all the notice she took\nof him.\n81\nGood Indian frowned with genuine puzzlement, and began slowly to\nwash his hands, glancing at her often in hope that he might meet\nher eyes. When she did not seem to see him at all, the smile of\na secret shared joyously with her died from his own eyes, and\nwhen he had dried his hands upon his handkerchief he cast aside\nhis inward shyness in the presence of the Hart boys and Miss\nGeorgie and Baumberger, and went boldly over to her.\n”Aren’t you feeling well?” he asked, with tender proprietorship\nin his tone.\n”I’m feeling quite well, thank you,” returned Evadna frigidly,\nneglecting to look at him.\n”What is the matter, then? Aren’t you having a good time?”\n”I’m enjoying myself very much–except that your presence annoys\nme. I wish you’d go away.”\nGood Indian turned on his heel and went; he felt that at last\nEvadna was looking at him, though he would not turn to make sure.\nAnd his instinct told him withal that he must ignore her mood if\nhe would win her from it. With a freakish impulse, he headed\nstraight for the campﬁre and Miss Georgie, but when he came up\nto her the look she gave him of understanding, with sympathy to\nsoften it, sent him away again without speaking.\nHe wandered back to the river’s edge–this time some distance\nfrom where Evadna sat–and began throwing pebbles at the black\nnose of a wave-washed bowlder away toward the other side. Clark\nand Gene, loitered up, watched him lazily, and, picking up other\npebbles, started to do the same thing. Soon all the boys were\nthrowing at the bowlder, and were making a good deal of noise\nover the various hits and misses, and the spirit of rivalry waxed\nstronger and stronger until it was like any other game wherein\nfull-blooded youths strive against one another for supremacy.\nThey came to the point of making bets, at ﬁrst extravagant and\nthen growing more and more genuinely in earnest, for we’re\ngamblers all, at heart.\nMiss Georgie burned a frying-panful of ﬁsh until they sent up an\nacrid, blue smoke, while she ran over to try her luck with a\nstone or two. Even Baumberger heaved himself up from where he\nwas lounging, and strolled over to watch. But Evadna could not\nhave stuck closer to her rock if she had been glued there, and if\nshe had been blind and deaf she would not have appeared more\noblivious.\nGood Indian grew anxious, and then angry. The savage stirred\nwithin him, and counseled immediate and complete mastery of\n82\nher–his woman. But there was the white man of him who said the\nthought was brute] and unchivalrous, and reminded the savage that\none must not look upon a woman as a chattel, to be beaten or\ncaressed, as the humor seized the master. And, last of all,\nthere was the surface of him laughing with the others, ﬂeering\nat those who fell short of the mark, and striving his utmost to\nbe ﬁrst of them all in accuracy.\nHe even smiled upon Miss Georgie when she hit the bowlder fairly,\nand, when the stench of the burning ﬁsh drifted over to them, he\ngave his supply of pebbles into her two hands, and ran to the\nrescue. He caught Evadna in the act of regarding him sidelong,\njust as a horse sometimes will keep an eye on the man with the\nrope in a corral; so he knew she was thinking of him, at least,\nand was wondering what he meant to do next, and the savage in him\nlaughed and lay down again, knowing himself the master.\nWhat he did was to throw away the burnt ﬁsh, clean the\nfrying-pan, and start more sizzling over the ﬁre, which he\nkicked into just the right condition. He whistled softly to\nhimself while he broke dry sticks across his knee for the ﬁre,\nand when Miss Georgie cried out that she had made three hits in\nsuccession, he called back: ”Good shot!” and took up the tune\nwhere he had left oﬀ. Never, for one instant, was he\nunconscious of Evadna’s secret watchfulness, and never, for one\ninstant, did he let her see that she was in his thoughts.\nHe ﬁnished frying the ﬁsh, set out the sandwiches and\ndoughnuts, and pickled peaches and cheese, and pounded upon a tin\nplate to announce that dinner was ready. He poured the coﬀee\ninto the cups held out to him, and got the ﬂask of cream from a\nniche between two rocks at the water’s edge. He said ”Too bad,”\nwhen it became generally known that the glare of the sun upon the\nwater had given Evadna a headache, and he said it exactly as he\nwould have spoken if Jack, for instance, had upset the sugar.\nHe held up the broken-handled butcher knife that was in the camp\nkit, and declaimed tragically: ”Is this a dagger that I see\nbefore me?” and much more of the kind that was eery. He saw the\nreluctant dimple which showed ﬂeetingly in Evadna’s cheek, and\nalso the tears which swelled her eyelids immediately after, but\nshe did not know that he saw them, though another did.\nHe was taken wholly by surprise when Miss Georgie, walking past\nhim afterward on her way to an enticing pool, nipped his arm for\nattention and murmured:\n”You’re doing ﬁne–only don’t overdo it. She’s had just about\nall she can stand right now. Give her a chance to forgive\nyou–and let her think she came out ahead! Good luck!” Whereupon\n83\nshe ﬁnished whatever she pretended to have been doing to her\nﬁshing-tackle, and beckoned Wally and Jack to come along.\n”We’ve just got to catch that big one,” she laughed, ”so Mr.\nBaumberger can go home and attend to his own business!” It took\nimagination to feel sure there had been a signiﬁcant accent on\nthe last of the sentence, and Baumberger must have been\nimaginative. He lowered his head like a bull meditating assault,\nand his leering eyes shot her a glance of inquiry and suspicion.\nBut Miss Georgie Howard met his look with a smile that was\nnothing more than idle amusement.\n”I’d like nothing better than to get that four-pounder on my\nline,” she added. ”It would be the joke of the season–if a\nwoman caught him.”\n”Bet you couldn’t land him,” chuckled Baumberger, breathing a\nsigh which might have been relief, and ambled away contentedly.”I\nmay not see you folks again till supper,” he bethought him to\ncall back. ”I’m going to catch a dozen more–and then I thought\nI’d take ’em up to Pete Hamilton; I’m using his horse, yuh see,\nand–” He ﬂung out a hand to round oﬀ the sentence, turned, and\nwent stumbling over a particularly rocky place.\nMiss Georgie stood where she was, and watched him with her mouth\ntwisted to one side and three perpendicular creases between her\neyebrows. When he was out of sight, she glanced at Evadna–once\nmore perched sulkily upon the rock.\n”Head still bad, chicken?” she inquired cheerfully. ”Better stay\nhere in the shade–I won’t be gone long.”\n”I’m going to ﬁsh,” said Evadna, but she did not stir, not even\nwhen Miss Georgie went on, convoyed by all the Hart boys.\nGood Indian had volunteered the information that he was going to\nﬁsh downstream, but he was a long time in tying his leader and\nfussing with his reel. His preparations were ﬁnished just when\nthe last straggler of the group was out of sight. Then he laid\ndown his rod, went over to Evadna, took her by the arm, and drew\nher back to the farther shelter of the ledge.\n”Now, what’s the trouble?” he asked directly. ”I hope you’re not\ntrying to make yourself think I was only– You know what I meant,\ndon’t you? And you said yes. You said it with your lips, and\nwith your eyes. Did you want more words? Tell me what it is\nthat bothers you.”\nThere was a droop to Evadna’s shoulders, and a tremble to her\nmouth. She would not look at him. She kept her eyes gazing\n84\ndownward, perhaps to hide tears. Good Indian waited for her to\nspeak, and when it seemed plain that she did not mean to do so,\nhe yielded to his instinct and took her in his arms.\n”Sweetheart!” he murmured against her ear, and it was the ﬁrst\ntime he had ever spoken the word to any woman. ”You love me, I\nknow it. You won’t say it, but I know you do. I should have\nfelt it this morning if you hadn’t cared. You–you let me kiss\nyou. And–”\n”And after that you–you rode oﬀ and left me–and you went away\nby yourself, just as if–just as if nothing had happened, and\nyou’ve acted ever since as if–” She bit her lips, turned her\nface away from him, plucked at his hands to free herself from his\nclasping arms, and then she laid her face down against him, and\nsobbed.\nGood Indian tried his best to explain his mood and his actions\nthat day, and if he did not make himself very clear–which could\nscarcely be expected, since he did not quite understand it\nhimself–he at least succeeded in lifting from her the weight of\ndoubt and of depression.\nThey were astonished when Wally and Jack and Miss Georgie\nsuddenly confronted them and proved, by the number of ﬁsh which\nthey carried, that they had been gone longer than ten minutes or\nso. They were red as to their faces, and embarrassed as to\nmanner, and Good Indian went away hurriedly after the horses,\nwithout meeting the quizzical glances of the boys, or replying t\nto certain pointed remarks which they ﬁred after him.\n”And he’s the buckaroo that’s got no use for girls!” commented\nWally, looking after him, and ran his tongue meditatively along\nthe loose edge of his cigarette. ”Kid, I wish you’d tell me how\nyou done it. It worked quick, anyhow.”\n”And thorough,” grinned Jack. ”I was thinking some of falling in\nlove with you myself, Vad. Soon as some of the shine wore oﬀ,\nand you got so you acted like a real person.”\n”I saw it coming, when it ﬁrst heaved in sight,” chirped Miss\nGeorgie, in a more cheerful tone than she had used that day; in\ntoo cheerful a tone to be quite convincing, if any one there had\nbeen taking notice of mere tones.\n85\nCHAPTER XIV\nTHE CLAIM-JUMPERS\n”Guess that bobcat was after my ducks again, last night,”\ncommented Phoebe Hart, when she handed Baumberger his cup of\ncoﬀee. ”The way the dogs barked all night–didn’t they keep you\nawake?”\n”Never slept better in my life,” drawled Baumberger, his voice\nsliding upward from the ﬁrst word to the last. His blood-shot\neyes, however, rather gave the lie to his statement. ”I’m going\nto make one more try, ’long about noon, for that big one–girls\ndidn’t get him, I guess, for all their threats, or I’d heard\nabout it. And I reckon I’ll take the evening train home.\nShoulda gone yesterday, by rights. I’d like to get a basket uh\nﬁsh to take up with me. Great coﬀee, Mrs. Hart, and such cream\nI never did see. I sure do hate to leave so many good things and\ngo back to a boardin’ house. Look at this honey, now!” He sighed\ngluttonously, leaning slightly over the table while he fed.\n”Dogs were barking at something down in the orchard,” Wally\nvolunteered, passing over Baumberger’s monologue. ”I was going\ndown there, but it was so dark–and I thought maybe it was Gene’s\nghost. That was before the moon came up. Got any more biscuits,\nmum?”\n”My trap wasn’t sprung behind the chicken-house,” said Donny. ”I\nlooked, ﬁrst thing.”\n”Dogs,” drawled Baumberger, his enunciation muﬄed by the food\nin his mouth, ”always bark. And cats ﬁght on shed-roofs. Next\ndoor to where I board there’s a dog that goes on shift as regular\nas a policeman. Every night at–”\n”Oh, Aunt Phoebe!” Evadna, crisp and cool in a summery dress of\nsome light-colored stuﬀ, and looking more than ever like a\nChristmas angel set a-ﬂutter upon the top of a holiday ﬁr in a\nsudden gust of wind, threw open the door, rushed halfway into the\nroom, and stopped beside the chair of her aunt. Her hands\ndropped to the plump shoulder of the sitter. ”Aunt Phoebe,\nthere’s a man down at the farther end of the strawberry patch!\nHe’s got a gun, Aunt Phoebe, and he’s camped there, and when he\nheard me he jumped up and pointed the gun straight at me!”\n”Why, honey, that can’t be–you must have seen an Indian prowling\nafter windfalls oﬀ the apricot trees there. He wouldn’t hurt\nyou.” Phoebe reached up, and caught the hands in a reassuring\n86\nclasp.\nEvadna’s eyes strayed from one face to another around the table\ntill they rested upon Good Indian, as having found sanctuary\nthere.\n”But, Aunt Phoebe, he was WASN’T. He was a white man. And he\nhas a camp there, right by that tree the lightning peeled the\nbark oﬀ. I was close before I saw him, for he was sitting down\nand the currant bushes were between. But I went through to get\nround where Uncle Hart has been irrigating and it’s all mud, and\nhe jumped up and pointed the gun AT me. Just as if he was going\nto shoot me. And I turned and ran.” Her ﬁngers closed upon the\nhand of her aunt, but her eyes clung to Good Indian, as though it\nwas to him she was speaking.\n”Tramp,” suggested Baumberger, in a tone of soothing ﬁnality, as\nwhen one hushes the fear of a child. ”Sick the dogs on him.\nHe’ll go–never saw the hobo yet that wouldn’t run from a dog.”\nHe smiled leeringly up at her, and reached for a second helping\nof honey.\nGood Indian pulled his glance from Evadna, and tried to bore\nthrough the beefy mask which was Baumberger’s face, but all he\nfound there was a gross interest in his breakfast and a certain\nindulgent sympathy for Evadna’s fear, and he frowned in a baﬄed\nway.\n”Who ever heard of a tramp camped in our orchard!” ﬂouted\nPhoebe. ”They don’t get down here once a year, and then they\nalways come to the house. You couldn’t know there WAS any\nstrawberry patch behind that thick row of trees–or a garden, or\nanything else.”\n”He’s got a row of stakes running clear across tho patch,” Evadna\nrecalled suddenly. ”Just like they do for a new street, or a\nrailroad, or something. And–”\nGood Indian pushed back his chair with a harsh, scraping noise,\nand rose. He was staring hard at Baumberger, and his whole face\nhad sharpened till it had the cold, unyielding look of an Indian.\nAnd suddenly Baumberger raised his head and met full that look.\nFor two breaths their eyes held each other, and then Baumberger\nglanced casually at Peaceful.\n”Sounds queer–must be some mistake, though. You must have seen\nsomething, girl, that reminded you of stakes. The stub oﬀ a\nsagebrush maybe?” He ogled her quite frankly. ”When a little\ngirl gets scared–Sick the dogs on him,” he advised the family\ncollectively, his manner changing to a blustering anxiety that\n87\nher fright should be avenged.\nEvadna seemed to take his tone as a direct challenge. ”I was\nscared, but I know quite well what I saw. He wasn’t a tramp. He\nhad a regular camp, with a coﬀee-pot and frying-pan and\nblankets. And there a line of stakes across the strawberry\npatch.”\nBefore, the breakfast had continued to seem an important incident\ntemporarily suspended. Now Peaceful Hart laid hand to his beard,\neyed his wife questioningly, let his glance ﬂicker over the\nfaces of his sons, and straightened his shoulders unconsciously.\nGood Indian was at the door, his mouth set in a thin, straight,\nﬁghting line. Wally and Jack were sliding their chairs back\nfrom the table preparing to follow him.\n”I guess it ain’t anything much,” Peaceful opined optimistically.\n”They can’t do anything but steal berries, and they’re most gone,\nanyhow. Go ask him what he wants, down there.” The last\nsentence was but feeble sort of ﬁction that his boys would await\nhis commands; as a matter of fact, they were outside before he\nspoke.\n”Take the dogs along,” called out Baumberger, quite as futilely,\nfor not one of the boys was within hearing.\nUntil they heard footsteps returning at a run, the four stayed\nwhere they were. Baumberger rumbled on in a desultory sort of\nway, which might have caused an observant person to wonder where\nwas his lawyer training, and the deep cunning and skill with\nwhich he was credited, for his words were as proﬁtless and\ninconsequential as an old woman’s. He talked about tramps, and\ndogs that barked o’ nights, and touched gallantly upon feminine\ntimidity and the natural, protective instincts of men.\nPeaceful Hart may have heard half of what he said–but more\nlikely he heard none of it. He sat drawing his white beard\nthrough his hand, and his mild, blue eyes were turned often to\nPhoebe in mute question. Phoebe herself was listening, but not\nto Baumberger; she was permitting Evadna to tuck in stray locks\nof her soft, brown hair, but her face was turned to the door\nwhich opened upon the porch. At the ﬁrst clatter of running\nfootsteps on the porch, she and Peaceful pushed back their chairs\ninstinctively.\nThe runner was Donny, and every freckle stood out distinctly upon\nhis face.\n”There’s four of ’em, papa!” he shouted, all in one breath.\n”They’re jumpin’ the ranch for placer claims. They said so.\n88\nEach one’s got a claim, and they’re campin’ on the corners, so\nthey’ll be close together. They’re goin’ to wash gold. Good\nInjun–”\n”Oh!” screamed Evadna suddenly. ”Don’t let him–don’t let them\nhurt him, Uncle Hart!”\n”Aw, they ain’t ﬁghtin’,” Donny assured her disgustedly.\n”They’re chewin’ the rag down there, is all. Good Injun knows\none of ’em.”\nPeaceful Hart stood indecisively, and stared, one and gripping\nthe back of his chair. His lips were working so that his beard\nbristled about his mouth.\n”They can’t do nothing–the ranch belongs to me,” he said, his\neyes turning rather helplessly to Baumberger. ”I’ve got my\npatent.”\n”Jumping our ranch!–for placer claims!” Phoebe stood up, leaning\nhard upon the table with both hands. ”And we’ve lived here ever\nsince Clark was a baby!”\n”Now, now, let’s not get excited over this,” soothed Baumberger,\ngetting out of his chair slowly, like the overfed glutton he was.\nHe picked up a crisp fragment of biscuit, crunched it between his\nteeth, and chewed it slowly. ”Can’t be anything serious–and if\nit is, why–I’m here. A lawyer right on the spot may save a lot\nof trouble. The main thing is, let’s not get excited and do\nsomething rash. Those boys–”\n”Not excited?–and somebody jumping–our–ranch?” Phoebe’s soft\neyes gleamed at him. She was pale, so that her face had a\npeculiar, ivory tint.\n”Now, now!” Baumberger put out a puﬀy hand admonishingly.\n”Let’s keep cool–that’s half the battle won. Keep cool.” He\nreached for his pipe, got out his twisted leather tobacco pouch,\nand opened it with a twirl of his thumb and ﬁnger.\n”You’re a lawyer, Mr. Baumberger,” Peaceful turned to him, still\nhelpless in his manner. ”What’s the best thing to be done?”\n”Don’t–get–excited.” Baumberger nodded his head for every\nword. ”That’s what I always say when a client comes to me all\nworked up. We’ll go down there and see just how much there is to\nthis, and–order ’em oﬀ. Calmly, calmly! No violence–no\nthreats–just tell ’em ﬁrmly and quietly to leave.” He stuﬀed\nhis pipe carefully, pressing down the tobacco with the tip of a\nﬁnger. ”Then,” he added with slow emphasis, ”if they don’t go,\n89\nafter–say twenty-four hours’ notice–why, we’ll proceed to serve\nan injunction.” He drew a match along the back of his chair, and\nlighted his pipe.\n”I reckon we’d better go and look after those boys of yours,” he\nsuggested, moving toward the door rather quickly, for all his\napparent deliberation. ”They’re inclined to be hot-headed, and\nwe must have no violence, above all things. Keep it a civil\nmatter right through. Much easier to handle in court, if there’s\nno violence to complicate the case.”\n”They’re looking for it,” Phoebe reminded him bluntly. ”The man\nhad a gun, and threw down on Vadnie.”\n”He only pointed it at me, auntie,” Evadna corrected, ignorant of\nthe Western phrase.\nThe two women followed the men outside and into the shady yard,\nwhere the trees hid completely what lay across the road and\nbeyond the double row of poplars. Donny, leaning far forward and\ndigging his bare toes into the loose soil for more speed, raced\non ahead, anxious to see and hear all that took place.\n”If the boys don’t stir up a lot of antagonism,” Baumberger kept\nurging Peaceful and Phoebe, as they hurried into the garden, ”the\nmatter ought to be settled without much trouble. You can get an\ninjunction, and–”\n”The idea of anybody trying to hold our place for mineral land!”\nPhoebe’s indignation was cumulative always, and was now bubbling\ninto wrath. ”Why, my grief! Thomas spent one whole summer\nwashing every likely spot around here. He never got anything\nbetter than colors on this ranch–and you can get them anywhere\nin Idaho, almost. And to come right into our garden, in the\nright–and stake a placer claim!” Her anger seemed beyond further\nutterance. ”The idea!” she ﬁnished weakly.\n”Well–but we mustn’t let ourselves get excited,” soothed\nBaumberger, the shadow of him falling darkly upon Peaceful and\nPhoebe as he strode along, upon the side next the sun. Peppajee\nwould have called that an evil thing, portending much trouble and\nblack treachery.\n”That’s where people always blunder in a thing like this. A\nlittle cool-headedness goes farther than hard words or lead.\nAnd,” he added cheeringly, ”it may be a false alarm, remember.\nWe won’t borrow trouble. We’ll just make sure of our ground,\nﬁrst thing we do.”\n”It’s always easy enough to be calm over the other fellow’s\n90\ntrouble,” said Phoebe sharply, irritated in an indeﬁnable way by\nthe oily optimism of the other. ”It ain’t your ox that’s gored,\nMr. Baumberger.”\nThey skirted the double row of grapevines, picked their way over\na spot lately ﬂooded from the ditch, which they crossed upon two\nplanks laid side by side, went through an end of the currant\npatch, made a detour around a small jungle of gooseberry bushes,\nand so came in sight of the strawberry patch and what was taking\nplace near the lightning-scarred apricot tree. Baumberger\nlengthened his stride, and so reached the spot ﬁrst.\nThe boys were grouped belligerently in the strawberry patch, just\noutside a line of new stakes, freshly driven in the ground.\nBeyond that line stood a man facing them with a .45-.70 balanced\nin the hollow of his arm. In the background stood three other\nmen in open spaces in the shrubbery, at intervals of ten rods or\nso, and they also had riﬂes rather conspicuously displayed.\nThey were grinning, all three. The man just over the line was\nlistening while Good Indian spoke; the voice of Good Indian was\neven and quiet, as if he were indulging in casual small talk of\nthe country, but that particular claim-jumper was not smiling.\nEven from a distance they could see that he was ﬁdgeting\nuncomfortably while he listened, and that his breath was\nbeginning to come jerkily.\n”Now, roll your blankets and GIT!” Good Indian ﬁnished sharply,\nand with the toe of his boot kicked the nearest stake clear of\nthe loose soil. He stooped, picked it up, and cast it\ncontemptuously from him. It landed three feet in front of the\nman who had planted it, and he jumped and shifted the riﬂe\nsigniﬁcantly upon his arm, so that the butt of it caressed his\nright shoulder-joint.\n”Now, now, we don’t want any overt acts of violence here,”\nwheezed Baumberger, laying hand upon Good Indian’s shoulder from\nbehind. Good Indian shook oﬀ the touch as if it were a\ntarantula upon him.\n”You go to the devil,” he advised chillingly.\n”Tut, tut!” Baumberger reproved gently. ”The ladies are within\nhearing, my boy. Let’s get at this thing sensibly and calmly.\nViolence only makes things worse. See how quiet Wally and Jack\nand Clark and Gene are! THEY realize how childishly spiteful it\nwould be for them to follow your example. They know better.\nThey don’t want–”\nJack grinned, and hitched his gun into plainer view. ”When we\nstart in, it won’t be STICKS we’re sending to His Nibs,” he\n91\nobserved placidly. ”We’re just waiting for him to ante.”\n”This,” said Baumberger, a peculiar gleam coming into his\nleering, puﬀy-lidded eyes, and a certain hardness creeping into\nhis voice, ”this is a matter for your father and me to settle.\nIt’s just-a-bide-beyond you youngsters. This is a civil case.\nDon’t foolishly make it come under the criminal code. But\nthere!” His voice purred at them again. ”You won’t. You’re all\ntoo clear-headed and sensible.”\n”Oh, sure!” Wally gave his characteristic little snort.”We’re\nonly just standing around to see how fast the cabbages grow!”\nBaumberger advanced boldly across the dead line.\n”Stanley, put down that gun, and explain your presence here and\nyour object,” he rumbled. ”Let’s get at this thing right end to.\nFirst, what are you doing here?”\nThe man across the line did not put down his riﬂe, except that\nhe let the butt of it drop slightly away from his shoulder so\nthat the sights were in alignment with an irrigating shovel\nthrust upright into the ground ten feet to one side of the\ngroup. His manner lost little of its watchfulness, and his voice\nwas surly with deﬁance when he spoke. But Good Indian,\nregarding him suspiciously through half-closed lids, would have\nsworn that a look of intelligence ﬂashed between those two.\nThere was nothing more than a quiver of his nostrils to betray\nhim as he moved over beside Evadna–for the pure pleasure of\nbeing near her, one would think; in reality, while the pleasure\nwas there, that he might see both Baumberger’s face and Stanley’s\nwithout turning more than his eyes.\n”All there is to it,” Stanley began blustering, ”you see before\nyuh. I’ve located twenty acres here as a placer claim. That\nthere’s the northwest corner–ap-prox’m’tley–close as I could\ncome by sightin’. Your fences are straight with yer land, and I\nhappen to sabe all yer corners. I’ve got a right here. I\nbelieve this ground is worth more for the gold that’s in it than\nfor the turnips you can make grow on top–and that there makes\nmineral land of it, and as such, open to entry. That’s accordin’\nto law. I ain’t goin’ to build no trouble–but I sure do aim to\ndefend my prope’ty rights if I have to. I realize yuh may think\ndiﬀrunt from me. You’ve got a right to prove, if yuh can, that\nall this ain’t mineral land. I’ve got jest as much right to\nprove it is.”\nHe took a breath so deep it expanded visibly his chest–a broad,\nmuscular chest it was–and let his eyes wander deliberately over\nhis audience.\n92\n”That there’s where Istand,” he stated, with arrogant\nself-assurance. His mouth drew down at the corners in a smile\nwhich asked plainly what they were going to do about it, and\nintimated quite as plainly that he did not care what they did,\nthough he might feel a certain curiosity as an onlooker.\n”I happen to know–” Peaceful began, suddenly for him. But\nBaumberger waved him into silence.\n”You’ll have to prove there’s gold in paying quantities here,” he\nstated pompously.\n”That’s what I aim to do,” Stanley told him imperturbably.\n”Iproved, over ﬁfteen years ago, that there WASN’T,” Peaceful\ndrawled laconically, and sucked so hard upon his pipe that his\ncheeks held deep hollows.\nStanley grinned at him. ”Sorry I can’t let it go at that,” he\nsaid ironically. ”I reckon I’ll have to do some washin’ myself,\nthough, before I feel satisﬁed there ain’t.”\n”Then you haven’t panned out anything yet?” Phoebe caught him up.\nStanley’s eyes ﬂickered a questioning glance at Baumberger, and\nBaumberger puﬀed out his chest and said:\n”The law won’t permit you to despoil this man’s property without\ngood reason. We can serve an injunction–”\n”You can serve and be darned.” Stanley’s grin returned, wider\nthan before.\n”As Mr. Hart’s legal adviser,” Baumberger began, in the tone he\nemployed in the courtroom–a tone which held no hint of his\nwheezy chuckle or his oily reassurance–”I hereby demand that you\nleave this claim which you have staked out upon Thomas Hart’s\nranch, and protest that your continued presence here, after\ntwenty-four hours have expired, will be looked upon as malicious\ntrespass, and treated as such.”\nStanley still grinned. ”As my own legal adviser,” he returned\ncalmly, ”I hereby declare that you can go plumb to HEL-ena.”\nStanley evidently felt impelled to adapt his vocabulary to\nfeminine ears, for he glanced at them deprecatingly and as if he\nwished them elsewhere.\nIf either Stanley or Baumberger had chanced to look toward Good\nIndian, he might have wondered why that young man had come, of a\n93\nsudden, to resemble so strongly his mother’s people. He had that\nstoniness of expression which betrays strong emotion held rigidly\nin check, with which his quivering nostrils and the light in his\nhalf-shut eyes contrasted strangely. He had missed no ﬂeeting\nglance, no guarded tone, and he was thinking and weighing and\nmeasuring every impression as it came to him. Of some things he\nfelt sure; of others he was half convinced; and there was more\nwhich he only suspected. And all the while he stood there\nquietly beside Evadna, his attitude almost that of boredom.\n”I think, since you have been properly notiﬁed to leave,” said\nBaumberger, with the indeﬁnable air of a lawyer who gathers up\nhis papers relating to one case, thrusts them into his pocket,\nand turns his attention to the needs of his next client, ”we’ll\njust have it out with these other fellows, though I look upon\nStanley,” he added half humorously, ”as a test case. If he goes,\nthey’ll all go.”\n”Better say he’s a TOUGH case,” blurted Wally, and turned on his\nheel. ”What the devil are they standing around on one foot for,\nmaking medicine?” he demanded angrily of Good Indian, who\nunceremoniously left Evadna and came up with him. ”I’D run him\noﬀ the ranch ﬁrst, and do my talking about it afterward. That\nhunk uh pork is kicking up a lot uh dust, but he ain’t GETTING\nanywhere!”\n”Exactly.” Good Indian thrust both hands deep into his trousers\npockets, and stared at the ground before him.\nWally gave another snort. ”I don’t know how it hits you,\nGrant–but there’s something ﬁshy about it.”\n”Ex-actly.” Good Indian took one long step over the ditch, and\nwent on steadily.\nWally, coming again alongside, turned his head, and regarded him\nattentively.\n”Injun’s on top,” he diagnosed sententiously after a minute.\n”Looks like he’s putting on a good, thick layer uh war-paint,\ntoo.” He waited expectantly. ”You might hand me the brush when\nyou’re through,” he hinted grimly. ”I might like to get out\nafter some scalps myself.”\n”That so?” Good Indian asked inattentively, and went on without\nwaiting for any reply. They left the garden, and went down the\nroad to the stable, Wally passively following Grant’s lead.\nSomeone came hurrying after them, and they turned to see Jack.\nThe others had evidently stayed to hear the legal harangue to a\nclose.\n94\n”Say, Stanley says there’s four beside the fellows we saw,” Jack\nannounced, rather breathlessly, for he had been running through\nthe loose, heavy soil of the garden to overtake them. ”They’ve\nlocated twenty acres apiece, he says–staked ’em out in the night\nand stuck up their notices–and everyone’s going to STICK.\nThey’re all going to put in grizzlies and mine the whole thing,\nhe told dad. He just the same as accused dad right out of\ncovering up valuable mineral land on purpose. And he says the\nlaw’s all on their side.” He leaned hard against the stable, and\ndrew his ﬁngers across his forehead, white as a girl’s when he\npushed back his hat. ”Baumberger,” he said cheerlessly, ”was\nstill talking injunction when I left, but–” He ﬂung out his\nhand contemptuously.\n”I wish dad wasn’t so–” began Wally moodily, and let it go at\nthat.\nGood Indian threw up his head with that peculiar tightening of\nlips which meant much in the way of emotion.\n”He’ll listen to Baumberger, and he’ll lose the ranch listening,”\nhe stated distinctly. ”If there’s anything to do, we’ve got to\ndo it.”\n”We can run ’em oﬀ–maybe,” suggested Jack, his ﬁghting\ninstincts steadied by the vivid memory of four riﬂes held by\nfour men, who looked thoroughly capable of using them.\n”This isn’t a case of apple-stealing,” Good Indian quelled\nsharply, and got his rope from his saddle with the manner of a\nman who has deﬁnitely made up his mind.\n”What CAN we do, then?” Wally demanded impatiently.\n”Not a thing at present.” Good Indian started for the little\npasture, where Keno was feeding and switching methodically at the\nﬂies. ”You fellows can do more by doing nothing to-day than if\nyou killed oﬀ the whole bunch.”\nHe came back in a few minutes with his horse, and found the two\nstill moodily discussing the thing. He glanced at them casually,\nand went about the business of saddling.\n”Where you going?” asked Wally abruptly, when Grant was looping\nup the end of his latigo.\n”Just scouting around a little,” was the unsatisfactory reply he\ngot, and he scowled as Good Indian rode away.\n95\nCHAPTER XV\nSQUAW-TALK-FAR-OFF HEAP SMART\nGood Indian spoke brieﬂy with the good-looking young squaw, who\nhad a shy glance for him when he came up; afterward he took hold\nof his hat by the brim, and ducked through the low opening of a\nwikiup which she smilingly pointed out to him.\n”Howdy, Peppajee? How you foot?” he asked, when his unaccustomed\neyes discerned the old fellow lying back against the farther\nwall.\n”Huh! Him heap sick all time.” Having his injury thus brought\nafresh to his notice, Peppajee reached down with his hands, and\nmoved the foot carefully to a new position.\n”Last night,” Good Indian began without that ceremony of long\nwaiting which is a part of Indian etiquette, ”much men come to\nHart ranch. Eight.” He held up his two outspread hands, with\nthe thumbs tucked inside his palms. ”Come in dark, no seeum till\nsun come back. Makeum camp. One man put sticks in ground, say\nthat part belong him. Twenty acres.” He ﬂung up his hands,\nlowered them, and immediately raised them again. ”Eight men do\nthat all same. Have guns, grub, blankets–stop there all time.\nSay they wash gold. Say that ranch have much gold, stake placer\nclaims. Baumberger”–he saw Peppajee’s eyelids draw\ntogether–”tell men to go away. Tell Peaceful he ﬁght those\nmen–in court. You sabe Ask Great Father to tell those men they\ngo away, no wash gold on ranch.” He waited.\nThere is no hurrying the speech of an Indian. Peppajee smoked\nstolidly, his eyes half closed and blinking sleepily. The veneer\nof white men’s ways dropped from him when he entered his own\nwikiup, and he would not speak quickly.\n”Las’ night–mebbyso yo’ watchum?” he asked, as one who holds his\njudgment in abeyance.\n”I heap fool. I no watch. I let those men come while I think\nof–a girl. My eyes sleep.” Good Indian was too proud to parry,\ntoo bitter with himself to deny. He had not said the thing\nbefore, even to himself, but it was in his heart to hate his\nlove, because it had cost this catastrophe to his friends.\n”Kay bueno.” Peppajee’s voice was harsh. But after a time he\nspoke more sympathetically. ”Yo’ no watchum. Yo’ let heap\ntrouble come. This day yo’ heart bad, mebbyso. This day yo’ no\n96\nthinkum squaw all time. Mebbyso yo’ thinkum ﬁght, no sabe how\nyo’ ﬁght.”\nGrant nodded silently. It would seem that Peppajee understood,\neven though his speech was halting. At that moment much of the\nunfounded prejudice, which had been for a few days set aside\nbecause of bigger things, died within him. He had disliked\nPeppajee as a pompous egotist among his kind. His latent\nantagonism against all Indians because they were unwelcomely his\nblood relatives had crystallized here and there against; certain\nindividuals of the tribe. Old Hagar he hated coldly. Peppajee’s\nstaginess irritated him. In his youthful arrogance he had not\ntroubled to see the real man of mettle under that dingy green\nblanket. Now he looked at Peppajee with a startled sense that he\nhad never known him at all, and that Peppajee was not only a\ngrimy Indian–he was also a man.\n”Me no sabe one thing. One otha thing me sabe. Yo’ no b’lieve\nBaumberga one frien’. Him all same snake. Them mens come,\nBaumberga tellum come all time. All time him try for foolum\nPeaceful. Yo’ look out. Yo’ no sleepum mo’. All time yo’\nwatchum.”\n”I come here,” said Good Indian; ”I think you mebbyso hear talk,\nyou tell me. My heart heap sad, I let this trouble come. I want\nto kill that trouble. Mebbyso make my friends laugh, be heap\nglad those men no stealum ranch. You hear talk, mebbyso you tell\nme now.”\nPeppajee smoked imperturbably what time his dignity demanded. At\nlength he took the pipe from his mouth, stretched out his arm\ntoward Hartley, and spoke in his sonorous tone, calculated to add\nweight to his words.\n”Yo’ go speakum Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ,” he commanded. ”All time\nmakum talk–talk–” He drummed with his ﬁngers upon his left\nforearm. ”Mebbyso heap sabe. Heap sabe Baumberga kay bueno. He\nthinkum sabe stealum ranch. All time heap talk come Man-that-\ncoughs, come all same Baumberga. Heap smart, dat squaw.” A\nsmile laid its faint light upon his grim old lips, and was gone.\n”Thinkum yo’ heap bueno, dat squaw. All time glad for talkum\nyo’. Yo’ go.”\nGood Indian stood up, his head bent to avoid scraping his hat\nagainst the sloping roof of the wikiup.\n”You no hear more talk all time you watch?” he asked, passing\nover Miss Georgie’s possible aid or interest in the aﬀair.\n”Much talkum–no can hear. All time them damn’ Baumberga shut\n97\ndoor–no talkum loud. All time Baumberga walkum in dark. Walkum\nwhere apples grow, walkum grass, walkum all dat ranch all time.\nAll time me heap watchum. Snake come, bitum foot–no can watchum\nmo’. Dat time, much mens come. Yo’ sabe. Baumberga all time\ntalkum, him heap frien’ Peacefu’–heap snake all time. Speakum\ntwo tongue Yo’ no b’lievum. All time heap big liar, him. Yo’\ngo, speakum Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ. Bueno, dat squaw. Heap smart,\nall same mans. Yo’ go. Pikeway.” He settled back with a\ngesture of ﬁnality, and so Good Indian left him.\nOld Hagar shrilled maledictions after him when he passed through\nthe littered camp on his way back to where he had left his horse,\nbut for once he was deaf to her upbraidings. Indeed, he never\nheard her–or if he did, her clamor was to him as the yelping of\nthe dogs which ﬁlled his ears, but did not enter his thoughts.\nThe young squaw smiled at him shy-eyed as he went by her, and\nthough his physical eyes saw her standing demurely there in the\nshade of her wikiup, ready to shrink coyly away from too bold a\nglance, the man-mind of him was blind and took no notice. He\nneither heard the baﬄed screaming of vile epithets when old\nHagar knew that her venom could not strike through the armor of\nhis preoccupation, nor saw the hurt look creep into the soft eyes\nof the young squaw when his face did not turn toward her after\nthe ﬁrst inattentive glance.\nGood Indian was thinking how barren had been his talk with\nPeppajee, and was realizing keenly how much he had expected from\nthe interview. It is frequently by the depth of our\ndisappointment only that we can rightly measure the height of\nour hope. He had come to Peppajee for something tangible, some\nthing that might be called real evidence of the conspiracy he\nsuspected. He had got nothing but suspicion to match his own.\nAs for Miss Georgie Howard–\n”What can she do?” he thought resentfully, feeling as if he had\nbeen oﬀered a willow switch with which to ﬁght oﬀ a grizzly.\nIt seemed to him that he might as sensibly go to Evadna herself\nfor assistance, and that, even his infatuation was obliged to\nadmit, would be idiotic. Peppajee, he told himself when he\nreached his horse, was particularly foolish sometimes.\nWith that in his mind, he mounted–and turned Keno’s head toward\nHartley. The distance was not great–little more than half a\nmile–but when he swung from the saddle in the square blotch of\nshade east by the little, red station house upon the parched sand\nand cinders, Keno’s ﬂanks were heaving like the silent sobbing\nof a woman with the pace his master’s spurred heels had required\nof him.\n98\nMiss Georgie gave her hair a hasty pat or two, pushed a novel out\nof sight under a Boise newspaper, and turned toward him with a\nbreezily careless smile when he stepped up to the open door and\nstopped as if he were not quite certain of his own mind, or of\nhis welcome.\nHe was secretly thinking of Peppajee’s information that Miss\nGeorgie thought he was ”bueno,” and he was wondering if it were\ntrue. Not that he wanted it to be true! But he was man enough to\nlook at her with a keener interest than he had felt before. And\nMiss Georgie, if one might judge by her manner, was woman enough\nto detect that interest and to draw back her skirts, mentally,\nready for instant ﬂight into unapproachableness.\n”Howdy, Mr. Imsen?” she greeted him lightly. ”In what oﬃcial\ncapacity am I to receive you, please? Do YOU want to send a\ntelegram?” The accent upon the pronoun was very faint, but it was\nthere for him to notice if he liked. So much she helped him.\nShe was a bright young woman indeed, that she saw he wanted help.\n”I don’t believe I came to see you oﬃcially at all,” he said,\nand his eyes lighted a little as he looked at her. ”Peppajee Jim\ntold me to come. He said you’re a ’heap smart squaw, all same\nmans.’”\n”Item: One pound of red-and-white candy for Peppajee Jim next\ntime I see him.” Miss Georgie laughed–but she also sat down so\nthat her face was turned to the window. ”Are you in urgent need\nof a heap smart squaw?” she asked. ”I thought”–she caught\nherself up, and then went recklessly on–”I thought yesterday\nthat you had found one!”\n”It’s brains I need just now.” After the words were out, Good\nIndian wanted to swear at himself for seeming to belittle Evadna.\n”I mean,” he corrected quickly–”do you know what I mean? I’ll\ntell you what has happened, and if you don’t know then, and can’t\nhelp me, I’ll just have to apologize for coming, and get out.”\n”Yes, I think you had better tell me why you need me\nparticularly. I know the chicken’s perfect, and doesn’t lack\nbrains, and you didn’t mean that she does. You’re all stirred up\nover something. What’s wrong?” Miss Georgie would have spoken in\njust that tone if she had been a man or if Grant had been a\nwoman.\nSo Good Indian told her.\n”And you imagine that it’s partly your fault, and that it\nwouldn’t have happened if you had spent more time keeping your\nweather eye open, and not so much making love?” Miss Georgie\n99\ncould be very blunt, as well as keen. ”Well, I don’t see how you\ncould prevent it, or what you could have done–unless you had\nkicked old Baumberger into the Snake. He’s the god in this\nmachine. I’d swear to that.”\nGood Indian had been ﬁddling with his hat and staring hard at a\npile of old ties just outside the window. He raised his head,\nand regarded her steadily. It was beginning to occur to him\nthat there was a good deal to this Miss Georgie, under that\noﬀhand, breezy exterior. He felt himself drawn to her as a\nperson whom he could trust implicitly.\n”You’re right as far as I’m concerned,” he owned, with his queer,\ninscrutable smile. ”I think you’re also right about him. What\nmakes you think so, anyway?”\nMiss Georgie twirled a ring upon her middle ﬁnger for a moment\nbefore she looked up at him.\n”Do you know anything about mining laws?” she asked, and when he\nswung his head slightly to one side in a tacit negative, she went\non: ”You say there are eight jumpers. Concerted action, that.\nPremeditated. My daddy was a lawyer,” she threw in by way of\nexplanation. ”I used to help him in the oﬃce a good deal.\nWhen he–died, I didn’t know enough to go on and be a lawyer\nmyself, so I took to this.” She waved her hand impatiently\ntoward the telegraph instrument.\n”So it’s like this: Eight men can take placer claims–can hold\nthem, you know–for one man. That’s the limit, a hundred and\nsixty acres. Those eight men aren’t jumping that ranch as eight\nindividuals; they’re in the employ of a principal who is\nengineering the aﬀair. If I were going to shy a pebble at the\nhead mogul, I’d sure try hard to hit our corpulent friend with\nthe ﬁshy eye. And that,” she added, ”is what all these cipher\nmessages for Saunders mean, very likely. Baumberger had to have\nsomeone here to spy around for him and perhaps help him\nchoose–or at least get together–those eight men. They must\nhave come in on the night train, for I didn’t see them. I’ll bet\nthey’re tough customers, every mother’s son of them! Fighters\ndown to the ground, aren’t they?”\n”I only saw four. They were heeled, and ready for business, all\nright,” he told her. ”Soon as I saw what the game was, and that\nBaumberger was only playing for time and a free hand, I pulled\nout. I thought Peppajee might give me something deﬁnite to go\non. He couldn’t, though.”\n”Baumberger’s going to steal that ranch according to law, you\nsee,” Miss Georgie stated with conviction. ”They’ve got to pan\n100\nout a sample of gold to prove there’s pay dirt there, before they\ncan ﬁle their claims. And they’ve got to do their ﬁling in\nShoshone. I suppose their notices are up O.K. I wonder, now,\nhow they intend to manage that? I believe,” she mused, ”they’ll\nhave to go in person–I don’t believe Baumberger can do that all\nhimself legally. I’ve got some of daddy’s law-books over in my\ntrunk, and maybe I can look it up and make sure. But I know they\nhaven’t ﬁled their claims yet. They’ve GOT to take possession\nﬁrst, and they’ve got to show a sample of ore, or dust, it would\nbe in this case. The best thing to do–” She drew her eyebrows\ntogether, and she pinched her under lip between her thumb and\nforeﬁnger, and she stared abstractedly at Good Indian. ”Oh,\nhurry up, Grant!” she cried unguardedly. ”Think–think HARD,\nwhat’s best to do!”\n”The only thing I can think of,” he scowled, ”is to kill that–”\n”And that won’t do, under the circumstances,” she cut in airily.”\nThere’d still be the eight. I’D like,” she declared viciously,\n”to put rough-on-rats in his dinner, but I intend to refrain from\ndoing as I’d like, and stick to what’s best.”\nGood Indian gave her a glance of grateful understanding. ”This\nthing has hit me hard,” he conﬁded suddenly. ”I’ve been holding\nmyself in all day. The Harts are like my own folks. They’re all\nI’ve had, and she’s been–they’ve all been–” Then the instinct\nof repression walled in his emotion, and he let the rest go in a\nlong breath which told Miss Georgie all she needed to know. So\nmuch of Good Indian would never ﬁnd expression in speech; all\nthat was best of him would not, one might be tempted to think.\n”By the way, is there any pay dirt on that ranch?” Miss Georgie\nkept herself rigidly to the main subject.\n”No, there isn’t. Not,” he added dryly, ”unless it has grown\ngold in the last few years. There are colors, of course. All\nthis country practically can show colors, but pay dirt? No!”\n”Look out,” she advised him slowly, ”that pay dirt doesn’t grow\nover night! Sabe?”\nGood Indian’s eyes spoke admiration of her shrewdness.\n”I must be getting stupid, not to have thought of that,” he said.\n”Can’t give me credit for being ’heap smart’?” she bantered.\n”Can’t even let me believe I thought of something beyond the ken\nof the average person? Not,” she amended ironically, ”that I\nconsider YOU an average person! Would you mind”–she became\nsuddenly matter of fact–”waiting here while I go and rummage for\n101\na book I want? I’m almost sure I have one on mining laws. Daddy\nhad a good deal of that in his business, being in a mining\ncountry. We’ve got to know just where we stand, it seems to me,\nbecause Baumberger’s going to use the laws himself, and it’s with\nthe law we’ve got to ﬁght him.”\nShe had to go ﬁrst and put a stop to the hysterical chattering\nof the sounder by answering the summons. It proved to be a\nmessage for Baumberger, and she wrote it down in a spiteful\nscribble which left it barely legible.\n”Betraying professional secrets, but I don’t care,” she\nexclaimed, turning swiftly toward him. ”Listen to this:\n”’How’s ﬁshing? Landed the big one yet? Ready for fry?”’\nShe threw it down upon the table with a pettish gesture that was\nwholly feminine. ”Sounds perfectly innocent, doesn’t it? Too\nperfectly innocent, if you ask me.” She stared out of the window\nabstractedly, her brows pinched together and her lips pursed with\na corner between her teeth, much as she had stared after\nBaumberger the day before; and when she spoke she seemed to have\nswung her memory back to him then.\n”He came up yesterday–with ﬁsh for Pete, he SAID, and of course\nhe really did have some–and sent a wire to Shoshone. I found it\non ﬁle when I came back. That was perfectly innocent, too. It\nwas:\n”’Expect to land big one to-night. Plenty of small fry. Smooth\ntrail.’\n”I’ve an excellent memory, you see.” She laughed shortly.\n”Well, I’ll go and hunt up that book, and we’ll proceed to glean\nthe wisdom of the serpent, so that we won’t be compelled to\nremain as harmless as the dove! You won’t mind waiting here?”\nHe assured her that he would not mind in the least, and she ran\nout bareheaded into the hot sunlight. Good Indian leaned forward\na little in his chair so that he could watch her running across\nto the shack where she had a room or two, and he paid her the\ncompliment of keeping her in his thoughts all the time she was\ngone. He felt, as he had done with Peppajee, that he had not\nknown Miss Georgie at all until to-day, and he was a bit startled\nat what he was ﬁnding her to be.\n”Of course,” she laughed, when she rustled in again like a whiﬀ\nof fresh air, ”I had to go clear to the bottom of the last trunk\nI looked in. Lucky I only have three to my name, for it would\nhave been in the last one just the same, if I’d had two dozen and\n102\nhad ransacked them all. But I found it, thank Heaven!”\nShe came eagerly up to him–he was sitting in the beribboned\nrocker dedicated to friendly callers, and had the rug badly\nrumpled with his spurs, which he had forgotten to remove–and\nwith a sweep of her forearm she cleared the little table of\nnovel, newspaper, and a magazine and deck of cards, and barely\nsaved her box of chocolates from going bottom up on the ﬂoor.\n”Like candy? Help yourself, if you do,” she said, and tucked a\npiece into her mouth absent-mindedly before she laid the\nleather-bound book open on the table. ”Now, we’ll see what\ninformation Mr. Copp can give us. He’s a high authority–General\nLand Oﬃce Commissioner, if you please. He’s a few years\nold–several years old, for that matter–but I don’t think he’s\nout of date; I believe what he says still goes. M-m-m!-’Liens on\nMines’–’Clause Inserted in Patents’–’Aﬃdavits Taken Without\nNotice to Opposing’–oh, it must be here–it’s GOT to be here!”\nShe was running a somewhat sticky foreﬁnger slowly down the\nindex pages. ”It isn’t alphabetically arranged, which I consider\nsloppy of Mr. Copp. Ah-h! ’Minerals Discovered After Patent Has\nIssued to Agricultural Claimant’–two hundred and eight. We’ll\njust take a look at that ﬁrst. That’s what they’re claiming,\nyou know.” She hitched her chair closer, and ﬂipped the leaves\neagerly. When she found the page, they touched heads over it,\nthough Miss Georgie read aloud.\n”Oh, it’s a letter–but it’s a decision, and as such has weight.\nU m!\n”SIR: In reply to your letter of inquiry . . . I have to state\nthat all mineral deposits discovered on land after United States\nPatent therefor has issued to a party claiming under the laws\nregulating the disposal of agricultural lands, pass with the\npatent, and this oﬃce has no further jurisdiction in the\npremise. Very respectfully,”\n”’PASS WITH THE PATENT!’” Miss Georgie turned her face so that\nshe could look into Grant’s eyes, so close to her own. ”Old\nPeaceful must surely have his patent–Baumberger can’t be much of\na lawyer, do you think? Because that’s a ﬂat statement.\nThere’s no chance for any legal quibbling in that–IS there?”\n”That’s about as straight as he could put it,” Good Indian\nagreed, his face losing a little of its anxiety.\n”Well, we’ll just browse along for more of the same,” she\nsuggested cheerfully, and went back to the index. But ﬁrst she\ndrew a lead pencil from where it had been stabbed through her\n103\nhair, and marked the letter with heavy brackets, wetting the lead\non her tongue for emphasis.\n”’Agricultural Claimants Entitled to Full Protection,’” she read\nhearteningly from the index, and turned hastily to see what was\nto be said about it. It happened to be another decision rendered\nin a letter, and they jubilated together over the sentiment\nconveyed therein.\n”Now, here is what I was telling you, Grant,” she said suddenly,\nafter another long minute of studying silently the index.\n”’Eight Locaters of Placer Ground May Convey to One Party’–and\nBaumberger’s certainly that party!–’Who Can Secure Patent for\nOne Hundred and Sixty Acres.’ We’ll just read up on that, and\nﬁnd out for sure what the conditions are. Now, here”–she had\nfound the page quickly–”listen to this:\n”’I have to state that if eight bona-ﬁde locaters’\n(”Whether they’re that remains to be proven, Mr. Baumberger!”)\n’each having located twenty acres, in accordance with the\ncongressional rules and regulations, should convey all their\nright, title, and interest in said locations to one person, such\nperson might apply for a patent–’\n”And so on into tiresomeness. Really, I’m beginning to think\nBaumberger’s awfully stupid, to even attempt such a silly thing.\nHe hasn’t a legal leg to stand on. ’Goes with the patent’–that\nsounds nice to me. They’re not locating in good faith–those\neight jumpers down there.” She fortiﬁed herself with another\npiece of candy. ”All you need,” she declared briskly, ”is a good\nlawyer to take this up and see it through.”\n”You seem to be doing pretty well,” he remarked, his eyes\ndwelling rather intently upon her face, and smiling as they did\nso.\n”I can read what’s in the book,” she remarked lightly, her eyes\nupon its pages as if she were consciously holding them from\nmeeting his look. ”But it will take a lawyer to see the case\nthrough the courts. And let me tell you one thing very\nemphatically.” She looked at him brightly. ”Many a case as\nstrong as this has been lost, just by legal quibbling and\nignorance of how to handle it properly. Many a case without a\nleg to stand on has been won, by smooth work on the part of some\nlawyer. Now, I’ll just jot down what they’ll have to do, and\nprove, if they get that land–and look here, Mr. Man, here’s\nanother thing to consider. Maybe Baumberger doesn’t expect to\nget a patent. Maybe he means to make old Peaceful so deucedly\n104\nsick of the thing that he’ll sell out cheap rather than ﬁght the\nthing to a ﬁnish. Because this can be appealed, and taken up\nand up, and reopened because of some technical error–oh, as\nJenny Wren says in–in–”\n”’Our Mutual Friend?’” Good Indian suggested unexpectedly.\n”Oh, you’ve read it!–where she always says: ’ Iknow their\ntricks and their manners!’ And I do, from being so much with\ndaddy in the oﬃce and hearing him talk shop. I know that,\nwithout a single bit of justice on their side, they could carry\nthis case along till the very expense of it would eat up the\nranch and leave the Harts ﬂat broke. And if they didn’t ﬁght\nand keep on ﬁghting, they could lose it–so there you are.”\nShe shut the book with a slam. ”But,” she added more brightly\nwhen she saw the cloud of gloom settle blacker than before on his\nface, and remembered that he felt himself at least partly to\nblame, ”it helps a lot to have the law all on our side, and–”\nShe had to go then, because the dispatcher was calling, and she\nknew it must be a train order. ”We’ll read up a little more, and\nsee just what are the requirements of placer mining laws–and\nmaybe we can make it a triﬂe diﬃcult for those eight to\ncomply!” she told him over her shoulder, while her ﬁngers\nchittered a reply to the call, and then turned her attention\nwholly to receiving the message.\nGood Indian, knowing well the easy custom of the country which\nmakes smoking always permissible, rolled himself a cigarette\nwhile he waited for her to come back to his side of the room. He\nwas just holding the match up and waiting for a clear blaze\nbefore setting his tobacco aﬁre, when came a tap-tap of feet on\nthe platform, and Evadna appeared in the half-open doorway.\n”Oh!” she exclaimed, and widened her indigo eyes at him sitting\nthere and looking so much at home.\n”Come right in, chicken,” Miss Georgie invited cordially. ”Don’t\nstand there in the hot sun. Mr. Imsen is going to turn the seat\nof honor over to you this instant. Awfully glad you came. Have\nsome candy.”\nEvadna sat down in the rocker, thrust her two little feet out so\nthat the toe, of her shoes showed close together beyond the hem\nof her riding-skirt, laid her gauntleted palms upon the arms of\nthe chair and rocked methodically, and looked at Grant and then\nat Miss Georgie, and afterward tilted up her chin and smiled\nsuperciliously at an insurance company’s latest oﬀering to the\npublic in the way of a calendar two feet long.\n105\n”When did you come up?” Good Indian asked her, trying so hard to\nkeep a placating note out of his voice that he made himself sound\napologetic.\n”Oh–about an hour ago, I think,” Evadna drawled sweetly–the\nsweet tones which always mean trouble, when employed by a woman.\nGood Indian bit his lip, got up, and threw his cigarette out of\nthe window, and looked at her reproachfully, and felt vaguely\nthat he was misunderstood and most unjustly placed upon the\ndefensive.\n”I only came over,” Evadna went on, as sweetly as before, ”to say\nthat there’s a package at the store which I can’t very well\ncarry, and I thought perhaps you wouldn’t mind taking it–when\nyou go.”\n”I’m going now, if you’re ready,” he told her shortly, and\nreached for his hat.\nEvadna rocked a moment longer, making him wait for her reply.\nShe glanced at Miss Georgie still busy at the telegraph table,\ngave a little sigh of resignation, and rose with evident\nreluctance.\n”Oh–if you’re really going,” she drawled, and followed him\noutside.\nCHAPTER XVI\n”DON’T GET EXCITED!”\nLovers, it would seem, require much less material for a quarrel\nthan persons in a less exalted frame of mind.\nGood Indian believed himself very much in love with his Christmas\nangel, and was very much inclined to let her know it, but at the\nsame time he saw no reason why he should not sit down in Miss\nGeorgie’s rocking-chair, if he liked, and he could not quite\nbring himself to explain even to Evadna his reason for doing so.\nIt humiliated him even to think of apologizing or explaining, and\nhe was the type of man who resents humiliation more keenly than a\ndirect injury.\nAs to Evadna, her atmosphere was that of conscious and\nmagnanimous superiority to any feeling so humanly petty as\n106\njealousy–which is extremely irritating to anyone who is at all\nsensitive to atmospheric conditions.\nShe stopped outside the window long enough to chirp a commonplace\nsentence or two to Miss Georgie, and to explain just why she\ncouldn’t stay a minute longer. ”I told Aunt Phoebe I’d be back\nto lunch–dinner, I mean–and she’s so upset over those horrible\nmen planted in the orchard–did Grant tell you about it?–that I\nfeel I ought to be with her. And Marie has the toothache again.\nSo I really must go. Good-by–come down whenever you can, won’t\nyou?” She smiled, and she waved a hand, and she held up her\nriding-skirt daintily as she turned away. ”You didn’t say goodby\nto Georgie,” she reminded Grant, still making use of the chirpy\ntone. ”I hope I am not in any way responsible.”\n”I don’t see how you could be,” said Good Indian calmly; and\nthat, for some reason, seemed to intensify the atmosphere with\nwhich Evadna chose to surround herself.\nShe led Huckleberry up beside the store platform without giving\nGrant a chance to help, mounted, and started on while he was in\nafter the package–a roll not more than eight inches long, and\nweighing at least four ounces, which brought an ironical smile to\nhis lips. But she could not hope to outrun him on Huckleberry,\neven when Huckleberry’s nose was turned toward home, and he\ntherefore came clattering up before she had passed the straggling\noutpost of rusty tin cans which marked, by implication, the\nboundary line between Hartley and the sagebrush waste surrounding\nit.\n”You seem to be in a good deal of a hurry,” Good Indian observed.\n”Not particularly,” she replied, still chirpy as to tone and\nsupercilious as to her manner.\nIt would be foolish to repeat all that was said during that ride\nhome, because so much meaning was conveyed in tones and glances\nand in staring straight ahead and saying nothing. They were\nsparring politely before they were over the brow of the hill\nbehind the town; they were indulging in veiled sarcasm–which\ncame rapidly out from behind the veil and grew sharp and\nbitter–before they started down the dusty grade; they were not\nsaying anything at all when they rounded the Point o’ Rocks and\nheld their horses rigidly back from racing home, as was their\nhabit, and when they dismounted at the stable, they refused to\nlook at each other upon any pretext whatsoever.\nBaumberger, in his shirt-sleeves and smoking his big pipe,\nlounged up from the pasture gate where he had been indolently\nrubbing the nose of a buckskin two-year-old with an aﬀectionate\n107\ndisposition, and wheezed out the information that it was warm.\nHe got the chance to admire a very stiﬀ pair of shoulders and a\nneck to match for his answer.\n”I wasn’t referring to your manner, m’ son,” he chuckled, after\nhe had watched Good Indian jerk the latigo loose and pull oﬀ the\nsaddle, showing the wet imprint of it on Keno’s hide. ”I wish\nthe weather was as cool!”\nGood Indian half turned with the saddle in his hands, and slapped\nit down upon its side so close to Baumberger that he took a hasty\nstep backward, seized Keno’s dragging bridle-reins, and started\nfor the stable. Baumberger happened to be in the way, and he\nbacked again, more hastily than before, to avoid being run over.\n”Snow blind?” he interrogated, forcing a chuckle which had more\nthe sound of a growl.\nGood Indian stopped in the doorway, slipped oﬀ the bridle, gave\nKeno a hint by slapping him lightly on the rump, and when the\nhorse had gone on into the cool shade of the stable, and taking\nhis place in his stall, began hungrily nosing the hay in his\nmanger, he came back to unsaddle Huckleberry, who was nodding\nsleepily with his under lip sagging much like Baumberger’s while\nhe waited. That gentleman seemed to be once more obstructing the\npath of Good Indian. He dodged back as Grant brushed past him.\n”By the great immortal Jehosaphat!” swore Baumberger, with an\nugly leer in his eyes, ”I never knew before that I was so small I\ncouldn’t be seen with the naked eye!”\n”You’re so small in my estimation that a molecule would look like\na hay-stack alongside you!” Good Indian lifted the skirt of\nEvadna’s side-saddle, and proceeded calmly to loosen the cinch.\nHis forehead smoothed a triﬂe, as if that one sentence had\nrelieved him of some of his bottled bitterness.\n”YOU ain’t shrunk up none–in your estimation,” Baumberger forgot\nhis pose of tolerant good nature to say. His heavy jaw trembled\nas if he had been overtaken with a brief attack of palsy; so also\ndid the hand which replaced his pipe between his loosely\nquivering lips. ”That little yellow-haired witch must have given\nyuh the cold shoulder; but you needn’t take it out on me. Had a\nquarrel?” He painstakingly brushed some ashes from his sleeve,\nonce more the wheezing, chuckling fat man who never takes\nanything very seriously.\n”Did you ever try minding your own business?” Grant inquired with\nmuch politeness of tone.\n108\n”We-e-ell, yuh see, m’ son, it’s my business to mind other\npeople’s business!” He chuckled at what he evidently considered a\nwitty retort. ”I’ve been pouring oil on the troubled waters all\nforenoon–maybe I’ve kinda got the habit.”\n”Only you’re pouring it on a ﬁre this time.”\n”That dangerous, yuh mean?”\n”You’re liable to start a conﬂagration you can’t stop, and that\nmay consume yourself, is all.”\n”Say, they sure do teach pretty talk in them colleges!” he\npurred, grinning loosely, his own speech purposely uncouth.\nGood Indian turned upon him, stopped as quickly, and let his\nanger vent itself in a sneer. It had occurred to him that\nBaumberger was not goading him without purpose–because\nBaumberger was not that kind of man. Oddly enough, he had a\nshort, vivid, mental picture of him and the look on his face when\nhe was playing the trout; it seemed to him that there was\nsomething of that same cruel craftiness now in his eyes and\naround his mouth. Good Indian felt for one instant as if he were\nthat trout, and Baumberger was playing him skillfully. ”He’s\ntrying to make me let go all holds and tip my hand,” he thought,\nkeenly reading him, and he steadied himself.\n”What d’yuh mean by me pouring oil on ﬁre!” Baumberger urged\nbanteringly. ”Sounds like the hero talking to the villain in one\nof these here save-him-he’s-my-sweetheart plays.”\n”You go to the devil,” said Good Indian shortly.\n”Don’t repeat yourself, m’ son; it’s a sign uh failing powers.\nYou said that to me this morning, remember?\nAnd–don’t–get–excited!” His right arm raised slightly when he\nsaid that, as if he expected a blow for his answer.\nGood Indian saw that involuntary arm movement, but he saw it from\nthe tail of his eye, and he drew his lips a little tighter.\nClearly Baumberger was deliberately trying to force him into a\nrage that would spend some of its force in threats, perhaps. He\ntherefore grew cunningly calm, and said absolutely nothing. He\nled Huckleberry into the stable, came out, and shut the door, and\nwalked past Baumberger as if he were not there at all. And\nBaumberger stood with his head lowered so that his ﬂabby jaw was\nresting upon his chest, and stared frowningly after him until the\nyard gate swung shut behind his tall, stiﬄy erect ﬁgure.\n”I gotta WATCH that jasper,” he mumbled over his pipe, as a sort\n109\nof summing up, and started slowly to the house. Halfway there he\nspoke again in the same mumbling undertone. ”He’s got the Injun\nlook in his eyes t’-day. I gotta WATCH him.”\nHe did watch him. It is astonishing how a family can live for\nmonths together, and not realize how little real privacy there is\nfor anyone until something especial comes up for secret\ndiscussion. It struck Good Indian forcibly that afternoon,\nbecause he was anxious for a word in private with Peaceful, or\nwith Phoebe, and also with Evadna–if it was only to continue\ntheir quarrel.\nAt dinner he could not speak without being heard by all. After\ndinner, the family showed an unconscious disposition to ”bunch.”\nPeaceful and Baumberger sat and smoked upon that part of the\nporch which was coolest, and the boys stayed close by so that\nthey could hear what might be said about the amazing state of\naﬀairs down in the orchard.\nEvadna, it is true, strolled rather self-consciously oﬀ to the\nhead of the pond, carefully refraining, as she passed, from\nglancing toward Good Indian. He felt that she expected him to\nfollow, but he wanted ﬁrst to ask Peaceful a few questions, and\nto warn him not to trust Baumberger, so he stayed where he was,\nsprawled upon his back with a much-abused cushion under his head\nand his hat tilted over his face, so that he could see\nBaumberger’s face without the scrutiny attracting notice.\nHe did not gain anything by staying, for Peaceful had little to\nsay, seeming to be occupied mostly with dreamy meditations. He\nnodded, now and then, in response to Baumberger’s rumbling\nmonologues, and occasionally he removed his pipe from his mouth\nlong enough to reply with a sentence where the nod was not\nsuﬃcient. Baumberger droned on, mostly relating the details of\ncases he had won against long odds–cases for the most part\nsimilar to this claim-jumping business.\nNothing had been done that day, Grant gathered, beyond giving the\neight claimants due notice to leave. The boys were evidently\ndissatisﬁed about something, though they said nothing. They\nshifted their positions with pettish frequency, and threw away\ncigarettes only half smoked, and scowled at dancing leaf-shadows\non the ground.\nWhen he could no longer endure the inaction, he rose, stretched\nhis arms high above his head, settled his hat into place, gave\nJack a glance of meaning, and went through the kitchen to the\nmilk house. He felt sure that Baumberger’s ears were pricked\ntoward the sound of his footsteps, and he made them purposely\naudible.\n110\n”Hello, Mother Hart,” he called out cheerfully to Phoebe,\npottering down in the coolness. ”Any cream going to waste, or\nbuttermilk, or cake?” He went down to her, and laid his hand upon\nher shoulder with a caressing touch which brought tears into her\neyes. ”Don’t you worry a bit, little mother,” he said softly.\n”I think we can beat them at their own game. They’ve stacked the\ndeck, but we’ll beat it, anyhow.” His hand slid down to her arm,\nand gave it a little, reassuring squeeze.\n”Oh, Grant, Grant!” She laid her forehead against him for a\nmoment, then looked up at him with a certain whimsical\nsolicitude. ”Never mind our trouble now. What’s this about you\nand Vadnie? The boys seem to think you two are going to make a\nmatch of it. And HAVE you been quarreling, you two? I only\nwant,” she added, deprecatingly, ”to see my biggest boy happy,\nand if I can do anything in any way to help–”\n”You can’t, except just don’t worry when we get to scrapping.”\nHis eyes smiled down at her with their old, quizzical humor,\nwhich she had not seen in them for some days. ”I foresee that\nwe’re due to scrap a good deal of the time,” he predicted.\n”We’re both pretty peppery. But we’ll make out, all right. You\ndidn’t”–he blushed consciously–”you didn’t think I was going\nto–to fall dead in love–”\n”Didn’t I?” Phoebe laughed at him openly. ”I’d have been more\nsurprised if you hadn’t. Why, my grief! I know enough about\nhuman nature, I hope, to expect–”\n”Churning?” The voice of Baumberger purred down to them. There\nhe stood bulkily at the top of the steps, good-naturedly\nregarding them. ”Mr. Hart and I are goin’ to take a ride up to\nthe station–gotta send a telegram or two about this little\naﬀair”–he made a motion with his pipe toward the orchard–”and\nI just thought a good, cold drink of buttermilk before we start\nwouldn’t be bad.” His glance just grazed Good Indian, and passed\nhim over as being of no consequence.\n”If you don’t happen to have any handy, it don’t matter in the\nleast,” he added, and turned to go when Phoebe shook her head.\n”Anything we can get for yuh at the store, Mrs. Hart? Won’t be\nany trouble at all–Oh, all right.” He had caught another shake\nof the head.\n”We may be gone till supper-time,” he explained further, ”and I\ntrust to your good sense, Mrs. Hart, to see that the boys keep\naway from those fellows down there.” The pipe, and also his\nhead, again indicated the men in the orchard. ”We don’t want any\nill feeling stirred up, you understand, and so they’d better just\n111\nkeep away from ’em. They’re good boys–they’ll do as you say.”\nHe leered at her ingratiatingly, shot a keen, questioning look at\nGood Indian, and went his lumbering way.\nGrant went to the top of the steps, and made sure that he had\nreally gone before he said a word. Even then he sat down upon\nthe edge of the stairway with his back to the pond, so that he\ncould keep watch of the approaches to the spring-house; he had\nbecome an exceedingly suspicious young man overnight.\n”Mother Hart, on the square, what do you think of Baumberger?” he\nasked her abruptly. ”Come and sit down; I want to talk with\nyou–if I can without having the whole of Idaho listening.”\n”Oh, Grant–I don’t know what to think! He seems all right, and I\ndon’t know why he shouldn’t be just what he seems; he’s got the\nname of being a good lawyer. But something–well, I get notions\nabout things sometimes. And I can’t, somehow, feel just right\nabout him taking up this jumping business. I don’t know why. I\nguess it’s just a feeling, because I can see you don’t like him.\nAnd the boys don’t seem to, either, for some reason. I guess\nit’s because he won’t let ’em get right after those fellows and\ndrive ’em oﬀ the ranch. They’ve been uneasy as they could be\nall day.” She sat down upon a rough stool just inside the door,\nand looked up at him with troubled eyes. ”And I’m getting it,\ntoo–seems like I’d go all to pieces if I can’t do SOMETHING!”\nShe sighed, and tried to cover the sigh with a laugh–which was\nnot, however, a great success. ”I wish I could be as cool-headed\nas Thomas,” she said, with a tinge of petulance. ”It don’t seem\nto worry him none!”\n”What does he think of Baumberger? Is he going to let him take\nthe case and handle it to please himself?” Good Indian was\ntapping his boot-toe thoughtfully upon the bottom step, and\nglancing up now and then as a precaution against being overheard.\n”I guess so,” she admitted, answering the last question ﬁrst.\n”I haven’t had a real good chance to talk to Thomas all day.\nBaumberger has been with him most of the time. But I guess he\nis; anyway, Baumberger seems to take it for granted he’s got the\ncase. Thomas hates to hurt anybody’s feelings, and, even if he\ndidn’t want him, he’d hate to say so. But he’s as good a lawyer\nas any, I guess. And Thomas seems to like him well enough.\nThomas,” she reminded Good Indian unnecessarily, ”never does say\nmuch about anything.”\n”I’d like to get a chance to talk to him,” Good Indian observed.\n”I’ll have to just lead him oﬀ somewhere by main strength, I\nguess. Baumberger sticks to him like a bur to a dog’s tail.\nWhat are those fellows doing down there now ? Does anybody\n112\nknow?”\n”You heard what he said to me just now,” Phoebe said,\nimpatiently. ”He don’t want anybody to go near. It’s terribly\naggravating,” she confessed dispiritedly, ”to have a lot of\nruﬃans camped down, cool as you please, on your own ranch, and\nnot be allowed to drive ’em oﬀ. I don’t wonder the boys are all\nsulky. If Baumberger wasn’t here at all, I guess we’d have got\nrid of ’em before now. I don’t know as I think very much of\nlawyers, anyhow. I believe I’d a good deal rather ﬁght ﬁrst\nand go,to law about it afterward if I had to. But Thomas is\nso–CALM!”\n”I think I’ll go down and have a look,” said Good Indian\nsuddenly. ”I’m not under Baumberger’s orders, if the rest of the\nbunch is. And I wish you’d tell Peaceful I want to talk to him,\nMother Hart–will you? Tell him to ditch his guardian angel\nsomehow. I’d like to see him on the quiet if I can, but if I\ncan’t–”\n”Can’t be nice, and forgiving, and repentant, and–a dear?”\nEvadna had crept over to him by way of the rocks behind the pond,\nand at every pause in her questioning she pushed him forward by\nhis two shoulders. ”I’m so furious I could beat you! What do you\nmean, savage, by letting a lady stay all afternoon by herself,\nwaiting for you to come and coax her into being nice to you?\nDon’t you know I H-A-ATE you?” She had him by the ears, then,\npulling his head erratically from side to side, and she ﬁnished\nby giving each ear a little slap and laid her arms around his\nneck. ”Please don’t look at me that way, Aunt Phoebe,” she said,\nwhen she discovered her there inside the door. ”Here’s a\nhorrible young villain who doesn’t know how to behave, and makes\nme do all the making up. I don’t like him one bit, and I just\ncame to tell him so and be done. And I don’t suppose,” she\nadded, holding her two hands tightly over his mouth, ”he has a\nword to say for himself.”\nSince he was eﬀectually gagged, Grant had not a word to say.\nEven when he had pulled her hands away and held them prisoners in\nhis own, he said nothing. This was Evadna in a new and\nunaccountable mood, it seemed to him. She had certainly been\nvery angry with him at noon. She had accused him, in that\nroundabout way which seems to be a woman’s favorite method of\nreaching a real grievance, of being ﬁckle and neglectful and\ninconsiderate and a brute.\nThe things she had said to him on the way down the grade had\nrankled in his mind, and stirred all the sullen pride in his\nnature to life, and he could not forget them as easily as she\nappeared to have done. Good Indian was not in the habit of\n113\nsaying things, even in anger, which he did not mean, and he could\nnot understand how anyone else could do so. And the things she\nhad said!\nBut here she was, nevertheless, laughing at him and blushing\nadorably because he still held her fast, and making the blood of\nhim race most unreasonably.\n”Don’t scold me, Aunt Phoebe,” she begged, perhaps because there\nwas something in Phoebe’s face which she did not quite\nunderstand, and so mistook for disapproval of her behavior. ”I\nshould have told you last night that we’re–well, I SUPPOSE we’re\nsupposed to be engaged!” She twisted her hands away from him, and\ncame down the steps to her aunt. ”It all happened so\nunexpectedly–really, I never dreamed I cared anything for him,\nAunt Phoebe, until he made me care. And last night I couldn’t\ntell you, and this morning I was going to, but all this horrible\ntrouble came up–and, anyway,” she ﬁnished with a ﬂash of\npretty indignation, ”I think Grant might have told you himself! I\ndon’t think it’s a bit nice of him to leave everything like that\nfor me. He might have told you before he went chasing oﬀ to–to\nHartley.” She put her arms around her aunt’s neck. ”You aren’t\nangry, are you, Aunt Phoebe?” she coaxed. ”You–you know you\nsaid you wanted me to be par-TIC-ularly nice to Grant!”\n”Great grief, child! You needn’t choke me to death. Of course\nI’m not angry.” But Phoebe’s eyes did not brighten.\n”You look angry,” Evadna pouted, and kissed her placatingly.\n”I’ve got plenty to be worked up over, without worrying over your\nlove aﬀairs, Vadnie.” Phoebe’s eyes sought Grant’s anxiously.\n”I don’t doubt but what it’s more important to you than anything\nelse on earth, but I’m thinking some of the home I’m likely to\nlose.”\nEvadna drew back, and made a movement to go.\n”Oh, I’m sorry I interrupted you then, Aunt Phoebe. I suppose\nyou and Grant were busy discussing those men in the orchard–”\n”Don’t be silly, child. You aren’t interrupting anybody, and\nthere’s no call for you to run oﬀ like that. We aren’t talking\nsecrets that I know of.”\nIn some respects the mind of Good Indian was extremely simple and\ndirect. His knowledge of women was rudimentary and based largely\nupon his instincts rather than any experience he had had with\nthem. He had been extremely uncomfortable in the knowledge that\nEvadna was angry, and strongly impelled, in spite of his hurt\n114\npride, to make overtures for peace. He was puzzled, as well as\nsurprised, when she seized him by the shoulders and herself made\npeace so bewitchingly that he could scarcely realize it at ﬁrst.\nBut since fate was kind, and his lady love no longer frowned upon\nhim, he made the mistake of taking it for granted she neither\nasked nor expected him to explain his seeming neglect of her and\nhis visit to Miss Georgie at Hartley.\nShe was not angry with him. Therefore, he was free to turn his\nwhole attention to this trouble which had come upon his closest\nfriends. He reached out, caught Evadna by the hand, pulled her\nclose to him, and smiled upon her in a way to make her catch her\nbreath in a most unaccountable manner.\nBut he did not say anything to her; he was a young man unused to\ndalliance when there were serious things at hand.\n”I’m going down there and see what they’re up to,” he told\nPhoebe, giving Evadna’s hand a squeeze and letting it go. ”I\nsuspect there’s something more than keeping the peace behind\nBaumberger’s anxiety to have them left strictly alone. The boys\nhad better keep away, though.”\n”Are you going down in the orchard?” Evadna rounded her\nunbelievably blue eyes at him. ”Then I’m going along.”\n”You’ll do nothing of the kind, little Miss Muﬃt,” he declared\nfrom the top step.\n”Why not?”\n”I might want to do some swearing.” He grinned down at her, and\nstarted oﬀ.\n”Now, Grant, don’t you do anything rash!” Phoebe called after him\nsharply.\n”’Don’t–get–excited!’” he retorted, mimicking Baumberger.\n”I’m going a little way, whether you want me to or not,” Evadna\nthreatened, pouting more than ever.\nShe did go as far as the porch with him, and was kissed and sent\nback like a child. She did not, however, go back to her aunt,\nbut ran into her own room, where she could look out through the\ngrove toward the orchard–and to the stable as well, though that\nview did not interest her particularly at ﬁrst. It was pure\naccident that made her witness what took place at the gate.\n115\nCHAPTER XVII\nA LITTLE TARGET-PRACTICE\nA grimy buck with no hat of any sort and with his hair straggling\nunbraided over one side of his face to conceal a tumor which grew\njust over his left eye like a large, ripe plum, stood outside the\ngate, in doubt whether to enter or remain where he was. When he\nsaw Good Indian he grunted, fumbled in his blanket, and held out\na yellowish envelope.\n”Ketchum Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ,” he explained gutturally.\nGood Indian took the envelope, thinking it must be a telegram,\nthough he could not imagine who would be sending him one. His\nname was written plainly upon the outside, and within was a short\nnote scrawled upon a telegraph form:\n”Come up as soon as you possibly can. I’ve something to tell\nyou.”\nThat was what she had written. He read it twice before he looked\nup.\n”What time you ketchum this?” he asked, tapping the message with\nhis ﬁnger.\n”Mebbyso one hour.” The buck pulled a brass watch ostentatiously\nfrom under his blanket, held it to his ear a moment, as if he\nneeded auricular assurance that it was running properly, and\npointed to the hour of three. ”Ketchum one dolla, mebbyso\npikeway quick. No stoppum,” he said virtuously.\n”You see Peaceful in Hartley?” Good Indian asked the question\nfrom an idle impulse; in reality, he was wondering what it was\nthat Miss Georgie had to tell him.\n”Peacefu’, him go far oﬀ. On train. All same heap fat man go\n’long. Mebbyso Shoshone, mebbyso Pocatello.”\nGood Indian looked down at the note, and frowned; that, probably,\nwas what she had meant to tell him, though he could not see where\nthe knowledge was going to help him any. If Peaceful had gone to\nShoshone, he was gone, and that settled it. Undoubtedly he would\nreturn the next day–perhaps that night, even. He was beginning\nto feel the need of a quiet hour in which to study the tangle,\nbut he had a suspicion that Baumberger had some reason other than\na desire for peace in wanting the jumpers left to themselves, and\n116\nhe started toward the orchard, as he had at ﬁrst intended.\n”Mebbyso ketchum one dolla, yo’,” hinted Charlie, the buck.\nBut Good Indian went on without paying any attention to him. At\nthe road he met Jack and Wally, just returning from the orchard.\n”No use going down there,” Jack informed him sulkily. ”They’re\njust laying in the shade with their guns handy, doing nothing.\nThey won’t let anybody cross their line, and they won’t say\nanything–not even when you cuss ’em. Wally and I got black in\nthe face trying to make them come alive. Baumberger got back\nyet? Wally and I have got a scheme–”\n”He and your dad took the train for Shoshone. Say, does anyone\nknow what that bunch over in the meadow is up to?” Good Indian\nleaned his back against a tree, and eyed the two morosely.\n”Clark and Gene are over there,” said Wally. ”But I’d gamble\nthey aren’t doing any more than these fellows are. They haven’t\nstarted to pan out any dirt–they haven’t done a thing, it looks\nlike, but lay around in the shade. I must say I don’t sabe their\nplay. And the worst of it is,” he added desperately, ”a fellow\ncan’t do anything.”\n”I’m going to break out pretty darned sudden,” Jack observed\ncalmly. ”I feel it coming on.” He smiled, but there was a look\nof steel in his eyes.\nGood Indian glanced at him sharply.\n”Now, you fellows’ listen to me,” he said. ”This thing is partly\nmy fault. I could have prevented it, maybe, if I hadn’t been so\ntaken up with my own aﬀairs. Old Peppajee told me Baumberger\nwas up to some devilment when he ﬁrst came down here. He heard\nhim talking to Saunders in Pete Hamilton’s stable. And the ﬁrst\nnight he was here, Peppajee and I saw him down at the stable at\nmidnight, talking to someone. Peppajee kept on his trail till he\ngot that snake bite, and he warned me a plenty. But I didn’t\ntake much stock in it–or if I did–” He lifted his shoulders\nexpressively.\n”So,” he went on, after a minute of bitter thinking, ”I want you\nto keep out of this. You know how your mother would feel–You\ndon’t want to get foolish. You can keep an eye on them–to-night\nespecially. I’ve an idea they’re waiting for dark; and if I knew\nwhy, I’d be a lot to the good. And if I knew why old Baumberger\ntook your father oﬀ so suddenly, why–I’d be wiser than I am\nnow.” He lifted his hat, brushed the moisture from his forehead,\nand gave a grunt of disapproval when his eyes rested on Jack.\n117\n”What yuh loaded down like that for?” he demanded. ”You fellows\nbetter put those guns in cold storage. I’m like Baumberger in\none respect–we don’t want any violence!” He grinned without any\nfeeling of mirth.\n”Something else is liable to be put in cold storage ﬁrst,” Wally\nhinted, signiﬁcantly. ”I must say I like this standing around\nand looking dangerous, without making a pass! I wish something\nwould break loose somewhere.”\n”I notice you’re packing yours, large as life,” Jack pointed out.\n”Maybe you’re just wearing it for an ornament, though.”\n”Sure!” Good Indian, feeling all at once the utter futility of\nstanding there talking, left them grumbling over their forced\ninaction, without explaining where he was going, or what he meant\nto do. Indeed, he scarcely knew himself. He was in that\nuncomfortable state of mind where one feels that one must do\nsomething, without having the faintest idea of what that\nsomething is, or how it is to be done. It seemed to him that\nthey were all in the same mental befuddlement, and it seemed\nimpossible to stay on the ranch another hour without making a\nhostile move of some sort–and he knew that, when he did make a\nmove, he at least ought to know why he did it.\nThe note in his pocket gave him an excuse for action of some\nsort, even though he felt sure that nothing would come of it; at\nleast, he thought, he would have a chance to discuss the thing\nwith Miss Georgie again–and while he was not a man who must have\neverything put into words, he had found comfort and a certain\nclarity of thought in talking with her.\n”Why don’t you invite me to go along?” Evadna challenged from the\ngate, when he was ready to start. She laughed when she said it,\nbut there was something beneath the laughter, if he had only been\nclose enough to read it.\n”I didn’t think you’d want to ride through all that dust and heat\nagain to-day,” he called back. ”You’re better oﬀ in the shade.”\n”Going to call on ’Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ’–AGAIN?” She was still\nlaughing, with something else beneath the laugh.\nHe glanced at her quickly, wondering where she had gotten the\nname, and in his wonder neglected to make audible reply. Also he\npassed over the change to ride back to the gate and tell her\ngood-by–with a hasty kiss, perhaps, from the saddle–as a lover\nshould have done.\n118\nHe was not used to love-making. For him, it was settled that\nthey loved each other, and would marry some day–he hoped the day\nwould be soon. It did not occur to him that a girl wants to be\ntold over and over that she is the only woman in the whole world\nworth a second thought or glance; nor that he should stop and say\njust where he was going, and what he meant to do, and how\nreluctant he was to be away from her. Trouble sat upon his mind\nlike a dead weight, and dulled his perception, perhaps. He waved\nhis hand to her from the stable, and galloped down the trail to\nthe Point o’ Rocks, and his mind, so far as Evadna was concerned,\nwas at ease.\nEvadna, however, was crying, with her arms folded upon the top of\nthe gate, before the cloud which marked his passing had begun to\nsprinkle the gaunt, gray sagebushes along the trail with a fresh\nlayer of choking dust. Jack and Wally came up, scowling at the\nworld and ﬁnding no words to match their gloom. Wally gave her\na glance, and went on to the blacksmith shop, but Jack went\nstraight up to her, for he liked her well.\n”What’s the matter?” he asked dully. ”Mad because you can’t\nsmoke up the ranch?”\nEvadna fumbled blindly for her handkerchief, scoured her eyes\nwell when she found it, and put up the other hand to further\nshield her face.\n”Oh, the whole place is like a GRAVEYARD,” she complained.\n”Nobody will talk, or do anything but just wander around! I just\ncan’t STAND it!” Which was not frank of her.\n”It’s too hot to do much of anything,” he said apologetically.\n”We might take a ride, if you don’t mind the heat.”\n”You don’t want to ride,” she objected petulantly. ”Why didn’t\nyou go with Good Indian?” he countered.\n”Because I didn’t want to. And I do wish you’d quit calling him\nthat; he has a real name, I believe.”\n”If you’re looking for a scrap,” grinned Jack, ”I’ll stake you to\nmy six gun, and you can go down and kill oﬀ a few of those\nclaim-jumpers. You seem to be in just about the proper frame uh\nmind to murder the whole bunch. Fly at it!”\n”It begins to look as if we women would have to do something,”\nshe retorted cruelly. ”There doesn’t seem to be a man on the\nranch with spirit enough to stop them from digging up the\nwhole–”\n119\n”I guess that’ll be about enough,” Jack interrupted her, coldly.\n”Why didn’t you say that to Good Indian?”\n”I told you not to call him that. I don’t see why everybody is\nso mean to-day. There isn’t a person–”\nWhen Jack laughed, he shut his eyes until he looked through\nnarrow slits under heavy lashes, and showed some very nice teeth,\nand two deep dimples besides the one which always stood in his\nchin. He laughed then, for the ﬁrst time that day, and if\nEvadna had been in a less vixenish temper she would have laughed\nwith him just as everyone else always did. But instead of that,\nshe began to cry again, which made Jack feel very much a brute.\n”Oh, come on and be good,” he urged remorsefully. But Evadna\nturned and ran back into the house and into her room, and cried\nluxuriously into her pillow. Jack, peeping in at the window\nwhich opened upon the porch, saw her there, huddled upon the bed.\nIn the spring-house his mother sat crying silently over her\nhelplessness, and failed to respond to his comforting pats upon\nthe shoulder. Donny struck at him viciously when Jack asked him\nan idle question, and Charlie, the Indian with the tumor over his\neye, scowled from the corner of the house where he was squatting\nuntil someone oﬀered him fruit, or food, or tobacco. He was of\nan acquisitive nature, was Charlie–and the road to his favor\nmust be paved with gifts.\n”This is what I call hell,” Jack stated aloud, and went straight\naway to the strawberry patch, took up his stand with his toes\nagainst Stanley’s corner stake, cursed him methodically until he\nhad quite exhausted his vocabulary, and put a period to his\nforceful remarks by shooting a neat, round hole through Stanley’s\ncoﬀee-pot. And Jack was the mild one of the family.\nBy the time he had succeeded in puncturing recklessly the\nfrying-pan, and also the battered pan in which Stanley no doubt\nmeant to wash his samples of soil, his good humor returned. So\nalso did the other boys, running in long leaps through the garden\nand arriving at the spot very belligerent and very much out of\nbreath.\n”Got to do something to pass away the time,” Jack grinned,\nbringing his front sight once more to bear upon the coﬀee–pot,\nalready badly dented and showing three black holes. ”And I ain’t\noﬀering any violence to anybody. You can’t hang a man, Mr.\nStanley, for shooting up a frying-pan. And I wouldn’t–hurt–\nyou–for–anything!” He had just reloaded, so that his bullets\nsaw him to the end of the sentence.\n120\nStanley watched his coﬀee-pot dance and roll like a thing in\npain, and swore when all was done. But he did not shoot, though\none could see how his ﬁngers must itch for the feel of the\ntrigger.\n”Your old dad will sweat blood for this–and you’ll be packing\nyour blanket on your back and looking for work before snow\nﬂies,” was his way of summing up.\nStill, he did not shoot.\nIt was like throwing pebbles at the bowlder in the Malad, the day\nbefore.\nWhen Phoebe came running in terror toward the fusillade, with\nMarie and her swollen face, and Evadna and her red eyes following\nin great trepidation far behind, they found four claim-jumpers\npurple from long swearing, and the boys gleefully indulging in\nrevolver practice with various camp utensils for the targets.\nThey stopped when their belts were empty as well as their guns,\nand they went back to the house with the women, feeling much\nbetter. Afterward they searched the house for more ”shells,”\nclattering from room to room, and looking into cigar boxes and\nupon out-of-the-way shelves, while Phoebe expostulated in the\nimmediate background.\n”Your father would put a stop to it pretty quick if he was here,”\nshe declared over and over. ”Just because they didn’t shoot back\nthis time is no sign they won’t next time you boys go to\nhectoring them.” All the while she knew she was wasting her\nbreath, and she had a secret fear that her manner and her tones\nwere unconvincing. If she had been a man, she would have been\ntheir leader, perhaps. So she retreated at last to her favorite\nrefuge, the milk-house, and tried to cover her secret approval\nwith grumbling to herself.\nThere was a lull in the house. The boys, it transpired, had gone\nin a body to Hartley after more cartridges, and the cloud of dust\nwhich hovered long over the trail testiﬁed to their haste. They\nreturned surprisingly soon, and they would scarcely wait for\ntheir supper before they hurried back through the garden. One\nwould think that they were on their way to a dance, so eager they\nwere.\nThey dug themselves trenches in various parts of the garden, laid\nthemselves gleefully upon their stomachs, and proceeded to\nexchange, at the top of their strong, young voices, ideas upon\nthe subject of claim-jumping, and to punctuate their remarks with\nleaden periods planted neatly and with precision in the immediate\n121\nvicinity of one of the four.\nThey had some trouble with Donny, because he was always jumping\nup that he might yell the louder when one of the enemy was seen\nto step about uneasily whenever a bullet pinged closer than\nusual, and the riﬂes began to bark viciously now and then. It\nreally was unsafe for one to dance a clog, with ﬂapping arms and\ntaunting laughter, within range of those rises, and they told\nDonny so.\nThey ordered him back to the house; they threw clods of earth at\nhis bare legs; they threatened and they swore, but it was not\nuntil Wally got him by the collar and shook him with brotherly\nthoroughness that Donny retreated in great indignation to the\nhouse.\nThey were just giving themselves wholly up to the sport of\nsending little spurts of loose earth into the air as close as was\nsafe to Stanley, and still much too close for his peace of mind\nor that of his fellows, when Donny returned unexpectedly with the\nshotgun and an enthusiasm for real bloodshed.\nHe ﬁred once from the thicket of currant bushes, and, from the\nremarks which Stanley barked out in yelping staccato, he\npunctured that gentleman’s person in several places with the ﬁne\nshot of which the charge consisted. He would have ﬁred again if\nthe recoil had not thrown him quite oﬀ his balance, and it is\npossible that someone would have been killed as a result. For\nStanley began ﬁring with murderous intent, and only the dusk and\nGood Indian’s opportune arrival prevented serious trouble.\nGood Indian had talked long with Miss Georgie, and had agreed\nwith her that, for the present at least, there must be no\nviolence. He had promised her ﬂatly that he would do all in his\npower to keep the peace, and he had gone again to the Indian camp\nto see if Peppajee or some of his fellows could give him any\ninformation about Saunders.\nSaunders had disappeared unaccountably, after a surreptitious\nconference with Baumberger the day before, and it was that which\nMiss Georgie had to tell him. Saunders was in the habit of\nsleeping late, so that she did not know until noon that he was\ngone. Pete was worried, and garrulously feared the worst. The\nworst, according to Pete Hamilton, was sudden death of a\nhemorrhage.\nMiss Georgie asserted unfeelingly that Saunders was more in\ndanger of dying from sheer laziness than of consumption, and she\neven went so far as to hint cynically, that even his laziness was\nlargely hypocritical.\n122\n”I don’t believe there’s a single honest thing about the fellow,”\nshe said to Good Indian. ”When he coughs, it sounds as if he\njust did it for eﬀect. When he lies in the shade asleep, I’ve\nseen him watching people from under his lids. When he reads, his\nears seem always pricked up to hear everything that’s going on,\nand he gives those nasty little slanty looks at everybody within\nsight. I don’t believe he’s really gone–because I can’t imagine\nhim being really anything. But I do believe he’s up to something\nmean and sneaky, and, since Peppajee has taken this matter to\nheart, maybe he can ﬁnd out something. I think you ought to go\nand see him, anyway, Mr. Imsen.”\nSo Good Indian had gone to the Indian camp, and had afterward\nridden along the rim of the bluﬀ, because Sleeping Turtle had\nseen someone walking through the sagebrush in that direction.\nFrom the rim-rock above the ranch, Good Indian had heard the\nshooting, though the trees hid from his sight what was taking\nplace, and he had given over his search for Saunders and made\nhaste to reach home.\nHe might have gone straight down the bluﬀ afoot, through a rift\nin the rim-rock where it was possible to climb down into the\nﬁssure and squeeze out through a narrow opening to the\nbowlder-piled bluﬀ. But that took almost as much time as he\nwould consume in riding around, and so he galloped back to the\ngrade and went down at a pace to break his neck and that of Keno\nas well if his horse stumbled.\nHe reached home in time to see Donny run across the road with the\nshotgun, and the orchard in time to prevent a general rush upon\nStanley and his fellows–which was fortunate. He got them all\nout of the garden and into the house by sheer determination and\nbiting sarcasm, and bore with surprising patience their angry\nupbraidings. He sat stoically silent while they called him a\ncoward and various other things which were unpleasant in the\nextreme, and he even smiled when they ﬁnally desisted and\ntrailed oﬀ sullenly to bed.\nBut when they were gone he sat alone upon the porch, brooding\nover the day and all it had held of trouble and perplexity.\nEvadna appeared tentatively in the open door, stood there for a\nminute or two waiting for some overture upon his part, gave him a\nchilly good-night when she realized he was not even thinking of\nher, and left him. So great was his absorption that he let her\ngo, and it never occurred to him that she might possibly consider\nherself ill-used. He would have been distressed if he could have\nknown how she cried herself to sleep but, manlike, he would also\nhave been puzzled.\n123\nCHAPTER XVIII\nA SHOT FROM THE RIM-ROCK\nGood Indian was going to the stable to feed the horses next\nmorning, when something whined past him and spatted viciously\nagainst the side of the chicken-house. Immediately afterward he\nthought he heard the sharp crack which a riﬂe makes, but the\nwind was blowing strongly up the valley, and he could not be\nsure.\nHe went over to the chicken-house, probed with his knife-blade\ninto the plank where was the splintered hole, and located a\nbullet. He was turning it curiously in his ﬁngers when another\none plunked into the boards, three feet to one side of him; this\ntime he was sure of the gun-sound, and he also saw a puﬀ of blue\nsmoke rise up on the rim-rock above him. He marked the place\ninstinctively with his eyes, and went on to the stable, stepping\nrather more quickly than was his habit.\nInside, he sat down upon the oats-box, and meditated upon what he\nshould do. He could not even guess at his assailant, much less\nreach him. A dozen men could be picked oﬀ by a riﬂe in the\nhands of one at the top, while they were climbing that bluﬀ.\nEven if one succeeded in reaching the foot of the rim-rock, there\nwas a forty-foot wall of unscalable rock, with just the one\nnarrow ﬁssure where it was possible to climb up to the level\nabove, by using both hands to cling to certain sharp projections\nwhile the feet sought a niche here and there in the wall. Easy\nenough–if one were but left to climb in peace, but absolutely\nsuicidal if an enemy stood above.\nHe scowled through the little paneless window at what he could\nsee of the bluﬀ, and thought of the mile-long grade to be\nclimbed and the rough stretch of lava rock, sage, and scattered\nbowlders to be gone over before one could reach the place upon a\nhorse. Whoever was up there, he would have more than enough time\nto get completely away from the spot before it would be possible\nto gain so much as a glimpse of him.\nAnd who could he be? And why was he shooting at Good Indian, so\nfar a non-combatant, guiltless of even ﬁring a single shot since\nthe trouble began?\nWally came in, his hat far back on his head, a cigarette in the\ncorner of his mouth, and his manner an odd mixture of\nconciliation and deﬁance, ready to assume either whole-heartedly\n124\nat the ﬁrst word from the man he had cursed so unstintingly\nbefore he slept. He looked at Good Indian, caught sight of the\nleaden pellet he was thoughtfully turning round and round in his\nﬁngers, and chose to ignore for the moment any unpleasantness in\ntheir immediate past.\n”Where you ketchum?” he asked, coming a bit closer.\n”In the side of the chicken-house.” Good Indian’s tone was\nlaconic.\nWally reached out, and took the bullet from him that he might\njuggle it curiously in his own ﬁngers. ”I don’t think!” he\nscouted.\n”There’s another one there to match this,” Good Indian stated\ncalmly, ”and if I should walk over there after it, I’ll gamble\nthere’d be more.”\nWally dropped the ﬂattened bullet, stooped, and groped for it in\nthe litter on the ﬂoor, and when he had found it he eyed it more\ncuriously than before. But he would have died in his tracks\nrather than ask a question.\n”Didn’t anybody take a shot at you, as you came from the house?”\nGood Indian asked when he saw the mood of the other.\n”If he did, he was careful not to let me ﬁnd it out.” Wally’s\nexpression hardened.\n”He was more careless a while ago,” said Good Indian. ”Some\nfellow up on the bluﬀ sent me a little morning salute. But,” he\nadded slowly, and with some satisfaction, ”he’s a mighty poor\nshot.”\nJack sauntered in much as Wally had done, saw Good Indian sitting\nthere, and wrinkled his eyes shut in a smile.\n”Please, sir, I never meant a word I said!” he began, with\nexaggerated trepidation. ”Why the dickens didn’t you murder the\nwhole yapping bunch of us, Grant?” He clapped his hand\naﬀectionately upon the other’s shoulder. ”We kinda run amuck\nyesterday afternoon,” he confessed cheerfully, ”but it sure was\nfun while it lasted!”\n”There’s liable to be some more fun of the same kind,” Wally\ninformed him shortly. ”Good Injun says someone on the bluﬀ took\na shot at him when he was coming to the stable. If any of them\njumpers–”\n125\n”It’s easy to ﬁnd out if it was one of them,” Grant cut in, as\nif the idea had just come to him. We can very soon see if\nthey’re all on their little patch of soil. Let’s go take a\nlook.”\nThey went out guardedly, their eyes upon the rim-rock. Good\nIndian led the way through the corral, into the little pasture,\nand across that to where the long wall of giant poplars shut oﬀ\nthe view.\n”I admire courage,” he grinned, ”but I sure do hate a fool.”\nWhich was all the explanation he made for the detour that hid\nthem from sight of anyone stationed upon the bluﬀ, except while\nthey were passing from the stable-door to the corral; and that,\nJack said afterward, didn’t take all day.\nComing up from the rear, they surprised Stanley and one other\npeacefully boiling coﬀee in a lard pail which they must have\nstolen in the night from the ranch junk heap behind the\nblacksmith shop. The three peered out at them from a distant\nambush, made sure that there were only two men there, and went on\nto the disputed part of the meadows. There the four were\npottering about, craning necks now and then toward the ranch\nbuildings as if they half feared an assault of some kind. Good\nIndian led the way back to the stable.\n”If there was any way of getting around up there without being\nseen,” he began thoughtfully, ”but there isn’t. And while I\nthink of it,” he added, ”we don’t want to let the women know\nabout this.”\n”They’re liable to suspect something,” Wally reminded dryly, ”if\none of us gets laid out cold.”\nGood Indian laughed. ”It doesn’t look as if he could hit\nanything smaller than a haystack. And anyway, I think I’m the\nboy he’s after, though I don’t see why. I haven’t done a\nthing–yet.”\n”Let’s feed the horses and then pace along to the house, one at\na time, and ﬁnd out,” was Jack’s reckless suggestion. ”Anybody\nthat knows us at all can easy tell which is who. And I guess it\nwould be tolerably safe.”\nFoolhardy as the thing looked to be, they did it, each after his\nown manner of facing a known danger. Jack went ﬁrst because, as\nhe said, it was his idea, and he was willing to show his heart\nwas in the right place. He rolled and lighted a cigarette,\nwrinkled his eyes shut in a laugh, and strolled nonchalantly out\nof the stable.\n126\n”Keep an eye on the rim-rock, boys,” he called back, without\nturning his head. A third of the way he went, stopped dead\nstill, and made believe inspect something upon the ground at his\nfeet.\n”Ah, go ON!” bawled Wally, his nerves all on edge.\nJack dug his heel into the dust, blew the ashes from his\ncigarette, and went on slowly to the gate, passed through, and\nstood well back, out of sight under the trees, to watch.\nWally snorted disdain of any proceeding so spectacular, but he\nwas as he was made, and he could not keep his dare-devil spirit\nquite in abeyance. He twitched his hat farther back on his head,\nstuck his hands deep into his pockets, and walked deliberately\nout into the open, his neck as stiﬀ as a newly elected\npolitician on parade. He did not stop, as Jack had done, but he\nfacetiously whistled ”Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are\nmarching,” and he went at a pace which permitted him to ﬁnish\nthe tune before he reached the gate. He joined Jack in the\nshade, and his face, when he looked back to the stable, was\nanxious.\n”It must be Grant he wants, all right,” he muttered, resting one\nhand on Jack’s shoulder and speaking so he could not be overheard\nfrom the house. ”And I wish to the Lord he’d stay where he’s\nat.”\nBut Good Indian was already two paces from the door, coming\nsteadily up the path, neither faster nor slower than usual, with\nhis eyes taking in every object within sight as he went, and his\nthumb hooked inside his belt, near where his gun swung at his\nhip. It was not until his free hand was upon the gate that lack\nand Wally knew they had been holding their breath.\n”Well–here I am,” said Good Indian, after a minute, smiling down\nat them with the sunny look in his eyes. ”I’m beginning to think\nI had a dream. Only”–he dipped his ﬁngers into the pocket of\nhis shirt and brought up the ﬂattened bullet–”that is pretty\nblamed realistic–for a dream.” His eyes searched involuntarily\nthe rim-rock with a certain incredulity, as if he could not bring\nhimself to believe in that bullet, after all.\n”But two of the jumpers are gone,” said Wally. ”I reckon we\nstirred ’em up some yesterday, and they’re trying to get back at\nus.”\n”They’ve picked a dandy place,” Good Indian observed. ”I think\nmaybe it would be a good idea to hold that fort ourselves. We\n127\nshould have thought of that; only I never thought–”\nPhoebe, heavy-eyed and pale from wakefulness and worry, came\nthen, and called them in to breakfast. Gene and Clark came in,\nsulky still, and inclined to snappishness when they did speak.\nDonny announced that he had been in the garden, and that Stanley\ntold him he would blow the top of his head oﬀ if he saw him\nthere again. ”And I never done a thing to him!” he declared\nvirtuously.\nPhoebe set down the coﬀee-pot with an air of decision.\n”I want you boys to remember one thing,” she said ﬁrmly, ”and\nthat is that there must be no more shooting going on around here.\nIt isn’t only what Baumberger thinks–I don’t know as ho’s got\nanything to say about it–it’s what Ithink. I know I’m only a\nwoman, and you all consider yourselves men, whether you are or\nnot, and it’s beneath your dignity, maybe, to listen to your\nmother.\n”But your mother has seen the day when she was counted on as\nmuch, almost, as if she’d been a man. Why, great grief! I’ve\nstood for hours peeking out a knot-hole in the wall, with that\nsame old shotgun Donny got hold of, ready to shoot the ﬁrst\nInjun that stuck his nose from behind a rock.”\nThe color came into her cheeks at the memory, and a sparkle into\nher eyes. ”I’ve seen real ﬁghting, when it was a life-and-death\nmatter. I’ve tended to the men that were shot before my eyes,\nand I’ve sung hymns over them that died. You boys have grown up\non some of the stories about the things I’ve been through.\n”And here last night,” she reproached irritatedly, I heard\nsomeone say: ’Oh, come on–we’re scaring Mum to death!’ The idea!\n’scaring Mum!’ I can tell you young jackanapes one thing: If I\nthought there was anything to be gained by it, or if it would\nsave trouble instead of MAKING trouble,’MUM’ could go down there\nright now, old as she is, and SCARED as she is, and clean out the\nwhole, measly outﬁt!” She stared sternly at the row of faces\nbent over their plates.\n”Oh, you can laugh–it’s only your mother!” she exclaimed\nindignantly, when she saw Jack’s eyes go shut and Gene’s mouth\npucker into a tight knot. ”But I’ll have you to know I’m boss of\nthis ranch when your father’s gone, and if there’s any more of\nthat kid foolishness to-day–laying behind a currant bush and\nshooting COFFEE-POTS!–I’ll thrash the fellow that starts it! It\nisn’t the kind of ﬁghting I’VE been used to. I may be away\nbehind the times–I guess I am!–but I’ve always been used to the\nidea that guns weren’t to be used unless you meant business.\n128\nThis thing of getting out and PLAYING gun-ﬁght is kinda\nsickening to a person that’s seen the real thing.\n”’Scaring Mum to death!”’ She seemed to ﬁnd it very hard to\nforget that, or to forgive it. ”’SCARING MUM’–and Jack, there,\nwas born in the time of an Indian uprising, and I laid with your\nfather’s revolver on the pillow where I could put my hand on it,\nday or night! YOU scare Mum! MUM will scare YOU, if there’s any\nmore of that let’s-play-Injun business going on around this\nranch. Why, I’d lead you down there by the ear, every mother’s\nson of you, and tell that man Stanley to SPANK you!”\n”Mum can whip her weight in wildcats any old time,” Wally\nannounced after a heavy silence, and glared aggressively from one\nfoolish-looking face to another.\nAs was frequently the case, the wave of Phoebe’s wrath ebbed\nharmlessly away in laughter as the humorous aspect of her tirade\nwas brought to her attention.\n”Just the same, I want you should mind what I tell you,” she\nsaid, in her old motherly tone, ”and keep away from those\nruﬃans down there. You can’t do anything but make ’em mad,\nand give ’em an excuse for killing someone. When your father\ngets back, we’ll see what’s to be done.”\n”All right, Mum. We won’t look toward the garden to-day,” Wally\npromised largely, and held out his cup to her to be reﬁlled.”\nYou can keep my gun, if you want to make dead sure.”\n”No, I can trust my boys, I hope,” and she glowed with real pride\nin them when she said it.\nGood Indian lingered on the porch for half an hour or so, waiting\nfor Evadna to appear. She may have seen him through the\nwindow–at any rate she slipped out very quietly, and had her\nbreakfast half eaten before he suspected that she was up; and\nwhen he went into the kitchen, she was talking animatedly with\nMarie about Mexican drawn-work, and was drawing intricate little\ndiagrams of certain patterns with her fork upon the tablecloth.\nShe looked up, and gave him a careless greeting, and went back to\ndiscussing certain ”wheels” in the corner of an imaginary\nlunch-cloth and just how one went about making them. He made a\ntentative remark or two, trying to win her attention to himself,\nbut she pushed her cup and saucer aside to make room for further\nfork drawings, and glanced at him with her most exaggerated\nChristmas-angel look.\n”Don’t interrupt, please,” she said mincingly. ”This is\n129\nIMPORTANT. And,” she troubled to explain, ”I’m really in a\nhurry, because I’m going to help Aunt Phoebe make strawberry\njam.”\nIf she thought that would ﬁx his determination to remain and\nhave her to himself for a few minutes, she was mistaken in her\nman. Good Indian turned on his heel, and went out with his chin\nin the air, and found that Gene and Clark had gone oﬀ to the\nmeadow, with Donny an unwelcome attendant, and that Wally and\nJack were keeping the dust moving between the gate and the\nstable, trying to tempt a shot from the bluﬀ. They were much\ninclined to be skeptical regarding the bullet which Good Indian\ncarried in his breast-pocket.\n”WE can’t raise anybody,” Wally told him disgustedly, ”and I’ve\nmade three round trips myself. I’m going to quit fooling around,\nand go to work.”\nWhether he did or not, Good Indian did not wait to prove. He did\nnot say anything, either, about his own plans. He was hurt most\nunreasonably because of Evadna’s behavior, and he felt as if he\nwere groping about blindfolded so far as the Hart trouble was\nconcerned. There must be something to do, but he could not see\nwhat it was. It reminded him oddly of when he sat down with his\nalgebra open before him, and scowled at a problem where the x y\nz’s seemed to be sprinkled through it with a diabolical\nfrequency, and there was no visible means of discovering what the\nunknown quantities could possibly be.\nHe saddled Keno, and rode away in that silent preoccupation which\nthe boys called the sulks for want of a better understanding of\nit. As a matter of fact, he was trying to put Evadna out of his\nmind for the present, so that he could think clearly of what he\nought to do. He glanced often up at the rim-rock as he rode\nslowly to the Point o’ Rocks, and when he was halfway to the turn\nhe thought he saw something moving up there.\nHe pulled up to make sure, and a little blue ball puﬀed out like\na child’s balloon, burst, and dissipated itself in a thin,\ntrailing ribbon, which the wind caught and swept to nothing. At\nthe same time something spatted into the trail ahead of him,\nsending up a little spurt of ﬁne sand.\nKeno started, perked up his ears toward the place, and went on,\nstepping gingerly. Good Indian’s lips drew back, showing his\nteeth set tightly together. ”Still at it, eh?” he muttered\naloud, pricked Keno’s ﬂanks with his rowels, and galloped around\nthe Point.\nThere, for the time being, he was safe. Unless the shooter upon\n130\nthe rim-rock was mounted, he must travel swiftly indeed to reach\nagain a point within range of the grade road before Good Indian\nwould pass out of sight again. For the trail wound in and out,\nlooping back upon itself where the hill was oversleep, hidden\npart of the time from the receding wall of rock by huge bowlders\nand giant sage.\nGrant knew that he was safe from that quarter, and was wondering\nwhether he ought to ride up along the top of the bluﬀ before\ngoing to Hartley, as he had intended.\nHe had almost reached the level, and was passing a steep, narrow,\nlittle gully choked with rocks, when something started up so\nclose beside him that Keno ducked away and squatted almost upon\nhis haunches. His gun was in his hand, and his ﬁnger crooked\nupon the trigger, when a voice he faintly recognized called to\nhim softly:\n”Yo’ no shoot–no shoot–me no hurtum. All time yo’ frien’.”\nShe stood trembling beside the trail, a gay, plaid shawl about\nher shoulders in place of the usual blanket, her hair braided\nsmoothly with bright, red ribbons entwined through it. Her dress\nwas a plain slip of bright calico, which had four-inch roses,\nvery briery and each with a gaudy butterﬂy poised upon the\ntopmost petals running over it in an inextricable tangle. Beaded\nmoccasins were on her feet, and her eyes were frightened eyes,\nwith the wistfulness of a timid animal. Yet she did not seem to\nbe afraid of Good Indian.\n”I sorry I scare yo’ horse,” she said hesitatingly, speaking\nbetter English than before. ”I heap hurry to get here. I speak\nwith yo’.”\n”Well, what is it?” Good Indian’s tone was not as brusque as his\nwords; indeed, he spoke very gently, for him. This was the\ngood-looking young squaw he had seen at the Indian camp. ”What’s\nyour name?” he asked, remembering suddenly that he had never\nheard it.\n”Rachel. Peppajee, he my uncle.” She glanced up at him shyly,\nthen down to where the pliant toe of her moccasin was patting a\ntiny depression into the dust. ”Bad mans like for shoot yo’,”\nshe said, not looking directly at him again. ”Him up there, all\ntime walk where him can look down, mebbyso see you, mebbyso\nshootum.”\n”I know–I’m going to ride around that way and round him up.”\nUnconsciously his manner had the arrogance of strength and power\nto do as he wished, which belongs to healthy young males.\n131\n”N-o, no-o!” She drew a sharp breath ” o’ no good there! Dim\nshoot yo’. Yo’ no go! Ah-h–I sorry I tellum yo’ now. Bad mans,\nhim. I watch, I take care him no shoot. Him shoot, mebbyso I\nshoot!”\nWith a little laugh that was more a plea for gentle judgment than\nanything else, she raised the plaid shawl, and gave him a glimpse\nof a rather battered revolver, cheap when it was new and\nobviously well past its prime.\n”I want yo’–” she hesitated; ”I want yo’–be heap careful. I\nwant yo’ no ride close by hill. Ride far out!” She made a\nsweeping gesture toward the valley. ”All time I watch.”\nHe was staring at her in a puzzled way. She was handsome, after\nher wild, half-civilized type, and her anxiety for his welfare\ntouched him and besought his interest.\n”Indians go far down–” She swept her arm down the narrowing\nriver valley. ”Catch ﬁsh. Peppajee stay–no can walk far. I\nstay. All go, mebbyso stay ﬁve days.” Her hand lifted\ninvoluntarily to mark the number.\nHe did not know why she told him all that, and he could not learn\nfrom her anything about his assailant. She had been walking\nalong the bluﬀ, he gathered–though why, she failed to make\nclear to him. She had, from a distance, caught a glimpse of a\nman watching the valley beneath him. She had seen him raise a\nriﬂe, take long aim, and shoot–and she had known that he was\nshooting at Good Indian.\nWhen he asked her the second time what was her errand up\nthere–whether she was following the man, or had suspected that\nhe would be there–she shook her head vaguely and took refuge\nbehind the stolidity of her race.\nIn spite of her pleading, he put his horse to scrambling up the\nﬁrst slope which it was possible to climb, and spent an hour\nriding, gun in hand, along the rim of the bluﬀ, much as he had\nsearched it the evening before.\nBut there was nothing alive that he could discover, except a hawk\nwhich lifted itself languorously oﬀ a high, sharp rock, and\nﬂapped lazily out across the valley when he drew near. The man\nwith the riﬂe had disappeared as completely as if he had never\nbeen there, and there was not one chance in a hundred of hunting\nhim out, in all that rough jumble.\nWhen he was turning back at last toward Hartley, he saw Rachel\nfor a moment standing out against the deep blue of the sky, upon\n132\nthe very rim of the bluﬀ. He waved a hand to her, but she gave\nno sign; only, for some reason, he felt that she was watching him\nride away, and he had a brief, vagrant memory of the wistfulness\nhe had seen in her eyes.\nOn the heels of that came a vision of Evadna swinging in the\nhammock which hung between the two locust trees, and he longed\nunutterably to be with her there. He would be, he promised\nhimself, within the next hour or so, and set his pace in\naccordance with his desire, resolved to make short work of his\ninvestigations in Hartley and his discussion of late events with\nMiss Georgie.\nHe had not, it seemed to him, had more than two minutes with\nEvadna since that evening of rapturous memory when they rode home\ntogether from the Malad, and afterward sat upon the stone bench\nat the head of the pond, whispering together so softly that they\ndid not even disturb the frogs among the lily-pads within ten\nfeet of them. It was not so long ago, that evening. The time\nthat had passed since might be reckoned easily in hours, but to\nGood Indian it seemed a month, at the very least.\nCHAPTER XIX\nEVADNA GOES CALLING\n”I have every reason to believe that your two missing jumpers\ntook the train for Shoshone last night,” Miss Georgie made answer\nto Good Indian’s account of what had happened since he saw her.”\nTwo furtive-eyed individuals answering your description bought\nround-trip tickets and had me ﬂag sixteen for them. They got\non, all right. I saw them. And if they got oﬀ before the next\nstation they must have landed on their heads, because Sixteen was\nmaking up time and Shorty pulled the throttle wide open at the\nﬁrst yank, I should judge, from the way he jumped out of town.\nI’ve been expecting some of them to go and do their ﬁling\nstunt–and if the boys have begun to devil them any, the chances\nare good that they’d take turns at it, anyway. They’d leave\nsomeone always on the ground, that’s a cinch.\n”And Saunders,” she went on rapidly, ”returned safe enough. He\nsneaked in just before I closed the oﬃce last night, and asked\nfor a telegram. There wasn’t any, and he sneaked out again and\nwent to bed–so Pete told me this morning. And most of the\nIndians have pulled out–squaws, dogs, papooses, and all–on some\nﬁshing or hunting expedition. I don’t know that it has anything\n133\nto do with your aﬀairs, or would even interest you, though. And\nthere has been no word from Peaceful, and they can’t possibly get\nback now till the four-thirty–ﬁve.\n”And that’s all I can tell you, Mr. Imsen,” she ﬁnished crisply,\nand took up a novel with a signiﬁcance which not even the\ndullest man could have ignored.\nGood Indian stared, ﬂushed hotly, and made for the door.\n”Thank you for the information. I’m afraid this has been a lot\nof bother for you,” he said stiﬄy, gave her a ceremonious\nlittle bow, and went his way stiﬀ-necked and frowning.\nMiss Georgie leaned forward so that she could see him through the\nwindow. She watched him cross to the store, go up the three\nrough steps to the platform, and disappear into the yawning\nblackness beyond the wide-open door.\nShe did not open the novel and begin reading, even then. She\ndabbed her handkerchief at her eyes, muttered: ”My Heavens, what\na fool!” apropos of nothing tangible, and stared dully out at the\nforlorn waste of cinders with rows of shining rails running\nstraight across it upon ties half sunken in the black\ndesolation, and at the red abomination which was the pump-house\nsquatting beside the dripping tank, the pump breathing\nasthmatically as it labored to keep the sliding water gauge from\nstanding at the ﬁgure which meant reproach for the grimy\nattendant.\n”What a fool–what a fool!” she repeated at the end of ten moody\nminutes. Then she threw the novel into a corner of the room, set\nher lower jaw into the square lines of stubbornness, went over to\nthe sleeping telegraph instrument which now and then clicked and\ntwittered in its sleep, called up Shoshone, and commanded the\nagent there to send down a quart freezer of ice cream, a banana\ncake, and all the late magazines he could ﬁnd,\nincluding–especially including–the alleged ”funny” ones.\n”You certainly–are–the prize–fool!” she said, when she\nswitched oﬀ the current, and she said it with vicious emphasis.\nWhereupon she recovered the novel, seated herself determinedly in\nthe beribboned rocker, ﬂipped the leaves of the book spitefully\nuntil she found one which had a corner turned down, and read a\ngarden-party chapter much as she used to study her multiplication\ntable when she was ten and hated arithmetic.\nA freight was announced over the wire, arrived with a great\nwheezing and snorting, which ﬁnally settled to a rhythmic\ngasping of the air pump, while a few boxes of store supplies were\n134\nbeing dumped unceremoniously upon the platform. Miss Georgie was\nfreight agent as well as many other things, and she went out and\nstood bareheaded in the sun to watch the unloading.\nShe performed, with the unthinking precision which comes of long\npractice, the many little duties pertaining to her several\noﬃces, and when the wheels began once more to clank, and she\nhad waved her hand to the ﬁreman, the brakeman, and the\nconductor, and had seen the dirty ﬂags at the rear of the\nswaying caboose ﬂap out of sight around the low, sage-covered\nhill, she turned rather dismally to the parlor end of the oﬃce,\nand took up the book with her former air of grim determination.\nSo for an hour, perhaps.\n”Is Miss Georgie Howard at home?” It was Evadna standing in the\ndoorway, her indigo eyes ﬁxed with innocent gayety–which her\nmouth somehow failed to meet halfway in mirth–upon the reader.\n”She is, chicken, and overjoyed at the sight of you!” Miss\nGeorgie rose just as enthusiastically as if she had not seen\nEvadna slip from Huckleberry’s back, fuddle the tie-rope into\nwhat looked like a knot, and step lightly upon the platform. She\nhad kept her head down–had Miss Georgie–until the last\npossible second, because she was still being a fool and had\npermitted a page of her book to fog before her eyes. There was\nno fog when she pushed Evadna into the seat of honor, however,\nand her mouth abetted her eyes in smiling.\n”Everything at tho ranch is perfectly horrid,” Evadna complained\npathetically, leaning back in the rocking-chair. ”I’d just as\nsoon be shut up in a graveyard. You can’t IMAGINE what it’s\nlike, Georgie, since those horrible men came and camped around\nall over the place! All yesterday afternoon and till dark, mind\nyou, the boys were down there shooting at everything but the men,\nand they began to shoot back, and Aunt Phoebe was afraid the boys\nwould be hit, and so we all went down and–oh, it was awful! If\nGrant hadn’t come home and stopped them, everybody would have\nbeen murdered. And you should have heard how they swore at Grant\nafterward! They just called him everything they could think of\nfor making them stop. I had to sit around on the other side of\nthe house–and even then I couldn’t help hearing most of it.\n”And to-day it is worse, because they just go around like a lot\nof dummies and won’t do anything but look mean. Aunt Phoebe was\nso cross–CROSS, mind you!–because I burnt the jam. And some of\nthe jumpers are missing, and nobody knows where they went– and\nMarie has got the toothache worse than ever, and won’t go and\nhave it pulled because it will HURT! I don’t see how it can hurt\nmuch worse than it does now–she just goes around with tears\nrunning down into the ﬂannel around her face till I could SHAKE\n135\nher!” Evadna laughed–a self-pitying laugh, and rocked her small\nperson violently. ”I wish I could have an oﬃce and live in it\nand telegraph things to people,” she sighed, and laughed again\nmost adorably at her own childishness. ”But really and truly,\nit’s enough to drive a person CRAZY, down at the ranch!”\n”For a girl with a brand-new sweetheart–” Miss Georgie reproved\nquizzically, and reached for the inevitable candy box.\n”A lot of good that does, when he’s never there!” ﬂashed Evadna,\nunintentionally revealing her real grievance. ”He just eats and\ngoes–and he isn’t even there to eat, half the time. And when\nhe’s there, he’s grumpy, like all the rest.” She was saying the\nthings she had told herself, on the way up, that she would DIE\nrather than say; to Miss Georgie, of all people.\n”I expect he’s pretty worried, chicken, over that land business.”\nMiss Georgie oﬀered her candy, and Evadna waved the box from her\nimpatiently, as if her spirits were altogether too low for\nsweets.\n”Well, I’m very sure I’M not to blame for those men being there,”\nshe retorted petulantly. ”He”– she hesitated, and then plunged\nheedlessly on–”he acts just as if I weren’t anybody at all. I’m\nsure, if he expects me to be a doll to be played with and then\ndumped into a corner where I’m to smile and smile until he comes\nand picks me up again–”\n”Now, chicken, what’s the use of being silly?” Miss Georgie\nturned her head slightly away, and stared out of the window.\n”He’s worried, I tell you, and instead of sulking because he\ndoesn’t stay and make love–”\n”Well, upon my word! Just as if I wanted–”\n”You really ought to help him by being kind and showing a little\nsympathy, instead–”\n”It appears that the supply of sympathy–”\n”Instead of making it harder for him by feeling neglected and\nletting him see that you do. My Heavens above!” Miss Georgie\nfaced her suddenly with pink cheeks. ”When a man is up against a\nproblem–and carries his life in his hand–”\n”You don’t know a thing about it!” Evadna stopped rocking, and\nsat up very straight in the chair. ”And even if that were true,\nis that any reason why he should AVOID me? I’M not threatening\nhis life!”\n136\n”He doesn’t avoid you. And you’re acting sillier than I ever\nsupposed you could. He can’t be in two places at once, can he?\nNow, let’s be sensible, chicken. Grant–”\n”Oh–h!” There was a peculiar, sliding inﬂection upon that word,\nwhich made Miss Georgie’s hand shut into a ﬁst.\n”Grant”–Miss Georgie put a deﬁant emphasis upon it–”is doing\nall he can to get to the bottom of that jumping business.\nThere’s something crooked about it, and he knows it, and is\ntrying to–”\n”I know all that.” Evadna interrupted without apology.\n”Well, of course, if you DO–then I needn’t tell you how silly it\nis for you to complain of being neglected, when you know his time\nis all taken up with trying to ferret out a way to block their\nlittle game. He feels in a certain sense responsible–”\n”Yes, I know. He thinks he should have been watching somebody or\nsomething instead of–of being with me. He took the trouble to\nmake that clear to me, at least!” Evadna’s eyes were very blue\nand very bright, but there was no look of an angel in her face.\nMiss Georgie pressed her lips together tightly for a minute.\nWhen she spoke, she was cheerfully impersonal as to tone and\nmanner.\n”Chicken, you’re a little goose. The man is simply crazy about\nyou, and harassed to death with this ranch business. Once that’s\nsettled–well, you’ll see what sort of a lover he can be!”\n”Thank you so much for holding out a little hope and\nencouragement, my dear!” Evadna, by the way, looked anything but\nthankful; indeed, she seemed to resent the hope and the\nencouragement as a bit of unwarranted impertinence. She glanced\ntoward the door as if she meditated an immediate departure, but\nended by settling back in the chair and beginning to rock again.\n”It’s a nasty, underhand business from start to ﬁnish,” said\nMiss Georgie, ignoring the remark. ”It has upset everybody–me\nincluded, and I’m sure it isn’t my aﬀair. It’s just one of\nthose tricky cases that you know is rotten to the core, and yet\nyou can’t seem to get hold of anything deﬁnite. My dad had one\nor two experiences with old Baumberger–and if ever there was a\nsly old mole of a man, he’s one.\n”Did you ever take after a mole, chicken? They used to get in\nour garden at home. They burrow underneath the surface, you\nknow, and one never sees them. You can tell by the ridge of\n137\nloose earth that they’re there, and if you think you’ve located\nMr. Mole, and jab a stick down, why–he’s somewhere else, nine\ntimes in ten. I used to call them Baumbergers, even then. Dad,”\nshe ﬁnished reminiscently, ”was always jabbing his law stick\ndown where the earth seemed to move–but he never located old\nBaumberger, to my knowledge.”\nShe stopped, because Evadna, without a shadow of doubt, was\nlooking bored. Miss Georgie regarded her with the frown she used\nwhen she was applying her mental measuring-stick. She began to\nsuspect that Evadna was, after all, an extremely self-centered\nlittle person; she was sorry for the suspicion, and she was also\nconscious of a certain disappointment which was not altogether\nfor herself.\n”Ah, well”–she dismissed analysis and the whole subject with a\nlaugh that was partly yawn–”away with dull care. Away with dull\neverything. It’s too hot to think or feel. A real emotion is as\nsuperﬂuous and oppressive as a–a ’camel petticoat!” This time\nher laugh was real and infectiously carefree. ”Take oﬀ your\nhat, chicken. I’ll go beg a hunk of ice from my dear friend\nPeter, and make some lemonade as is lemonade; or claret punch, if\nyou aren’t a blue ribboner, or white-ribboner, or some other kind\nof a good-ribboner.” Miss Georgie hated herself for sliding into\nsheer ﬂippancy, but she preferred that extreme to the other, and\nshe could not hold her ground just then at the ”happy medium.”\nEvadna, however, seemed to disapprove of the ﬂippancy. She did\nnot take oﬀ her hat, and she stated evenly that she must go, and\nthat she really did not care for lemonade, or claret punch,\neither.\n”What, in Heaven’s name, DO you care for–besides yourself?”\nﬂared Miss Georgie, quite humanly exasperated. ”There,\nchicken–the heat always turns me snappy,” she repented\ninstantly. ”Please pinch me.” She held out a beautiful,\ntapering forearm, and smiled.\n”I’m the snappy one,” said Evadna, but she did not smile as she\nbegan drawing on her gauntlets slowly and deliberately.\nIf she were waiting for Miss Georgie to come back to the subject\nof Grant, she was disappointed, for Miss Georgie did not come to\nany subject whatever. A handcar breezed past the station, the\nfour section-men pumping like demons because of the slight down\ngrade and their haste for their dinner.\nHuckleberry gave one snort and one tug backward upon the tie rope\nand then a coltish kick into the air when he discovered that he\nwas free. After that, he took oﬀ through the sagebrush at a\n138\nlope, too worldly-wise to follow the trail past the store, where\nsomeone might rush out and grab him before he could dodge away.\nHe was a wise little pinto–Huckleberry.\n”And now, I suppose I’ll have the pleasure of walking home,”\ngrumbled Evadna, standing upon the platform and gazing, with much\nself-pity, after her runaway.\n”It’s noon–stay and eat dinner with me, chicken. Some of the\nboys will bring him back after you the minute he gets to the\nranch. It’s too hot to walk.” Miss Georgie laid a hand\ncoaxingly upon her arm.\nBut Evadna was in her mood of perversity. She wouldn’t stay to\ndinner, because Aunt Phoebe would be expecting her. She wouldn’t\nwait for Huckleberry to be brought back to her, because she would\nnever hear the last of it. She didn’t mind the heat the least\nbit, and she would walk. And no, she wouldn’t borrow Miss\nGeorgie’s parasol; she hated parasols, and she always had and\nalways would. She gathered up her riding-skirt, and went slowly\ndown the steps.\nMiss Georgie could be rather perverse herself upon occasion. She\nwaited until Evadna was crunching cinders under her feet before\nshe spoke another word, and then she only called out a ﬂippant,\n”Adios, senorita!”\nEvadna knew no Spanish at all. She lifted her shoulders in what\nmight be disdain, and made no reply whatever.\n”Little idiot!” gritted Miss Georgie–and this time she was not\nspeaking of herself.\nCHAPTER XX\nMISS GEORGIE ALSO MAKES A CALL\nSaunders, limp and apathetic and colorless, shuﬄed over to the\nstation with a wheelbarrow which had a decrepit wheel, that left\nan undulating imprint of its drunken progress in the dust as it\nwent. He loaded the boxes of freight with the abused air of one\nwho feels that Fate has used him hardly, and then sidled up to\nthe station door with the furtive air which Miss Georgie always\ninwardly resented.\nShe took the shipping bill from him with her ﬁngertips, reckoned\n139\nthe charges, and received the money without a word, pushing a few\npieces of silver toward him upon the table. As he bent to pick\nthem up clawing unpleasantly with vile ﬁnger-nails–she glanced\nat him contemptuously, looked again more attentively, pursed her\nlips with one corner between her teeth, and when he had clawed\nthe last dime oﬀ the smooth surface of the table, she spoke to\nhim as if he were not the reptile she considered him, but a live\nhuman.\n”Horribly hot, isn’t it? I wish Icould sleep till noon. It\nwould make the days shorter, anyway.”\n”I opened up the store, and then I went back to bed,” Saunders\nreplied limply. ”Just got up when the freight pulled in. Made\nso blamed much noise it woke me. I seem to need a good deal of\nsleep.” He coughed behind his hand, and lingered inside the\ndoor. It was so unusual for Miss Georgie to make conversation\nwith him that Saunders was almost pitifully eager to be\nagreeable.\n”If it didn’t sound cruel, this weather,” said Miss Georgie\nlightly, still looking at him–or, more particularly, at the\ncrumpled, soiled collar of his coarse blue shirt–”I’d advise you\nto get out of Hartley once a day, if it was no more than to take\na walk. Though to be sure,” she smiled, ”the prospect is not\ninviting, to say the least. Put it would be a change; I’d run up\nand down the track, if I didn’t have to stick here in this oﬃce\nall day.”\n”I can’t stand walking,” Saunders whined. ”It makes me cough.”\nTo illustrate, he gave another little hack behind his hand. ”I\nwent up to the stable yesterday with a book, and laid down in the\nhay. And I went to sleep, and Pete thought I was lost, I guess.”\nHe grinned, which was not pleasant, for he chewed tobacco and had\nugly, discolored teeth into the bargain.\n”I like to lay in the hay,” he added lifelessly. ”I guess I’ll\ntake my bed up there; that lean-to is awful hot.”\n”Well, you’re lucky that you can do exactly as you please, and\nsleep whenever you please.” Miss Georgie turned to her telegraph\ninstrument, and began talking in little staccato sparks of\nelectricity to the agent at Shoshone, merely as a hint to\nSaunders to take himself away.\n”Ain’t been anything for me?” he asked, still lingering.\nMiss Georgie shook her head. He waited a minute longer, and then\nsidled out, and when he was heard crunching over the cinders with\nhis barrow-load of boxes, she switched oﬀ the current abruptly,\n140\nand went over to the window to watch him.\n”Item,” she began aloud, when he was quite gone, her eyes staring\nvacantly down the scintillating rails to where they seemed to\nmeet in one glittering point far away in the desert.” Item–”\nBut whatever the item was, she jotted it down silently in that\nmental memorandum book which was one of her whims. ”Once I put a\nthing in that little blue book of mine,” she used to tell her\nfather, ”it’s there for keeps. And there’s the advantage that I\nnever leave it lying around to be lost, or for other people to\npick up and read to my everlasting undoing. It’s better than\ncipher–for I don’t talk in my sleep.”\nThe four- thirty- ﬁve train came in its own time, and brought\nthe two missing placer miners. But it did not bring Baumberger,\nnor Peaceful Hart, nor any word of either. Miss Georgie spent a\ngood deal of time staring out of the window toward the store that\nday, and when she was not doing that she was moving restlessly\nabout the little oﬃce, picking things up without knowing why\nshe did so, and laying them down again when she discovered them\nin her hands and had no use for them. The ice cream came, and\nthe cake, and the magazines; and she left the whole pile just\ninside the door without undoing a wrapping.\nAt ﬁve o’clock she rose abruptly from the rocker, in which she\nhad just deposited herself with irritated emphasis, and wired her\nchief for leave of absence until seven.\n”It’s important, Mr. Gray. Business which can’t wait,” she\nclicked urgently. ”I’ll be back before Eight is due. Please.”\nMiss Georgie did not often send that last word of her own\nvolition. All up and down the line she was said to be\n”Independent as a hog on ice”–a simile not pretty, perhaps, nor\neven exact, but frequently applied, nevertheless, to self-reliant\nsouls like the Hartley operator.\nBe that as it may, she received gracious permission to lock the\noﬃce door from the outside, and she was not long in doing so,\nand heaved a great sigh of relief when it was done. She went\nstraight to the store, and straight back to where Pete Hamilton\nwas leaning over a barrel redolent of pickled pork. He came up\nwith dripping hands and a treasure-trove of ﬂabby meat, and\nwhile he was dangling it over the barrel until the superﬂuous\nbrine dripped away, she asked him for a horse.\n”I dunno where Saunders is again,” he said, letting his consent\nbe taken for granted. ”But I’ll go myself and saddle up, if\nyou’ll mind the store. Soon as I ﬁnish waitin’ on this\ncustomer,” he added, casting a glance toward a man who sat upon\nthe counter and dangled his legs while he apathetically munched\n141\nstale pretzels and waited for his purchases.\n”Oh, I can saddle, all right, Pete. I’ve got two hours oﬀ, and\nI want to ride down to see how the Harts are getting along.\nExciting times down there, from all accounts.”\n”Maybe I can round up Saunders. He must be somewheres around,”\nPete suggested languidly, wrapping the pork in a piece of brown\npaper and reaching for the string which dangled from the ball\nhung over his head.\n”Saunders is asleep, very likely. If he isn’t in his room, never\nmind hunting him. The horse is in the stable, I suppose. I can\nsaddle better than Saunders.”\nPete tied the package, wiped his hands, and went heavily out. He\nreturned immediately, said that Saunders must be up at the\nstable, and turned his attention to weighing out ﬁve pounds of\nwhite beans.\nMiss Georgie helped herself to a large bag of mixed candy, and\nput the money in the drawer, laid her key upon the desk for\nsafe-keeping, repinned her white sailor hat so that the hot wind\nwhich blew should not take it oﬀ her head, and went cheerfully\naway to the stable.\nShe did not saddle the horse at once. She ﬁrst searched the\npile of sweet-smelling clover in the far end, made sure that no\nman was there, assured herself in the same manner of the fact\nthat she was absolutely alone in the stable so far as humans were\nconcerned, and continued her search; not for Saunders now, but\nfor sagebrush. She went outside, and looked carefully at her\nimmediate surroundings.\n”There’s hardly a root of it anywhere around close,” she said to\nherself. ”Nor around the store, either–nor any place where one\nwould be apt to go ordinarily.”\nShe stood there meditatively for a few minutes, remembered that\ntwo hours do not last long, and saddled hurriedly. Then,\nmounting awkwardly because of the large, lumpy bag of candy\nwhich she must carry in her hands for want of a pocket large\nenough to hold it, she rode away to the Indian camp.\nThe camp was merely a litter of refuse and the ashes of various\ncampﬁres, with one wikiup standing forlorn in the midst. Miss\nGeorgie never wasted precious time on empty ceremony, and she\nwould have gone into that tent unannounced and stated her errand\nwithout any compunction whatever. Put Peppajee was lying\noutside, smoking in the shade, with his foot bandaged and\n142\ndisposed comfortably upon a folded blanket. She tossed him the\nbag of candy, and stayed upon her horse.\n”Howdy, Peppajee? How your foot? Pretty well, mebbyso?”\n”Mebbyso bueno. Sun come two time, mebbyso walk all same no\nsnake biteum.” Peppajee’s eyes gloated over the gift as he laid\nit down beside him.\n”That’s good. Say, Peppajee,” Miss Georgie reached up to feel\nher hatpins and to pat her hair, ”I wish you’d watch Saunders.\nHim no good. I think him bad. I can’t keep an eye on him. Can\nyou?”\n”No can walk far.” Peppajee looked meaningly at his bandages.\n”No can watchum.”\n”Well, but you could tell somebody else to watch him. I think he\ndo bad thing to the Harts. You like Harts. You tell somebody to\nwatch Saunders.”\n”Indians pikeway–ketchum ﬁsh. Come back, mebbyso tellum\nwatchum.”\nMiss Georgie drew in her breath for further argument, decided\nthat it was not worth while, and touched up her horse with the\nwhip. ”Good-by,” she called back, and saw that Peppajee was\nlooking after her with his eyes, while his face was turned\nimpassively to the front.\n”You’re just about as satisfying to talk to as a stump,” she paid\ntribute to his unassailable calm. ”There’s four bits wasted,”\nshe sighed, ”to say nothing of the trouble I had packing that\ncandy to you–you ungrateful old devil.” With which unladylike\nremark she dismissed him from her mind as a possible ally.\nAt the ranch, the boys were enthusiastically blistering palms and\nstiﬀening the muscles of their backs, turning the water away\nfrom the ditches that crossed the disputed tracts so that the\ntrespassers there should have none in which to pan gold–or to\npretend that they were panning gold. Since the whole ranch was\nirrigated by springs running out here and there from under the\nbluﬀ, and all the ditches ran to meadow and orchard and patches\nof small fruit, and since the springs could not well be stopped\nfrom ﬂowing, the thing was not to be done in a minute.\nAnd since there were four boys with decided ideas upon the\nsubject–ideas which harmonized only in the fundamental desire to\nharry the interlopers, the thing was not to be done without much\ntime being wasted in fruitless argument.\n143\nWally insisted upon running the water all into a sandy hollow\nwhere much of it would seep away and a lake would do no harm, the\nmain objection to that being that it required digging at least a\nhundred yards of new ditch, mostly through rocky soil.\nJack wanted to close all the headgates and just let the water go\nwhere it wanted to–which was easy enough, but ineﬀective,\nbecause most of it found its way into the ditches farther down\nthe slope.\nGene and Clark did not much care how the thing was done–so long\nas it was done their way. At least, that is what they said.\nIt was Good Indian who at length settled the matter. There were\nﬁve springs altogether; he proposed that each one make himself\nresponsible for a certain spring, and see to it that no water\nreached the jumpers.\n”And I don’t care a tinker’s dam how you do it,” he said. ”Drink\nit all, if you want to. I’ll take the biggest–that one under\nthe milk-house.” Whereat they jeered at him for wanting to be\nclose to Evadna.\n”Well, who has a better right?” he challenged, and then\ninconsiderately left them before they could think of a\nsuﬃciently biting retort.\nSo they went to work, each in his own way, agreeing mostly in\nuntiring industry. That is how Miss Georgie found them\noccupied–except that Good Indian had stopped long enough to\nsoothe Evadna and her aunt, and to explain that the water would\nreally not rise much higher in the milk-house, and that he didn’t\nbelieve Evadna’s pet bench at the head of the pond would be\ninaccessible because of his eﬀorts.\nPhoebe was sloshing around upon the ﬂooded ﬂoor of her\nmilk-house, with her skirts tucked up and her indignation growing\ngreater as she gave it utterance, rescuing her pans of milk and\nher jars of cream. Evadna, upon the top step, sat with her feet\ntucked up under her as if she feared an instant inundation. She,\nalso, was giving utterance to her feminine irritation at the\ndiscomfort–of her aunt presumably, since she herself was high\nand dry.\n”And it won’t do a BIT of good. They’ll just knock that dam\nbusiness all to pieces to-night–” She was scolding Grant.\n”Swearing, chicken? Things must be in a great state!”\n144\nGrant grinned at Miss Georgie, forgetting for the moment his\nrebuﬀ that morning. ”She did swear, didn’t she?” he conﬁrmed\nwickedly. ”And she’s been working overtime, trying to reform me.\nWanted to pin me down to ’my goodness!’ and ’oh, dear!’–with all\nthis excitement taking place on the ranch!”\n”I wasn’t swearing at all. Grant has been shoveling sand all\nafternoon, building a dam over by the fence, and the water has\nbeen rising and rising till–” She waved her hand gloomily at her\nbedraggled Aunt Phoebe working like a motherly sort of gnome in\nits shadowy grotto. ”Oh, if I were Aunt Phoebe, I should just\nshake you, Grant Imsen!”\n”Try it,” he invited, his eyes worshiping her in her pretty\npetulance. ”I wish you would.”\nAs Miss Georgie went past them down the steps, her face had the\nset look of one who is consciously and deliberately cheerful\nunder trying conditions.\n”Don’t quarrel, children,” she advised lightly. ”Howdy, Mrs.\nHart? What are they trying to do–drown you?”\n”Oh, these boys of mine! They’ll be the death of me, what with\nthe things they won’t do, and the things they WILL do. They’re\ntrying now to create a water famine for the jumpers, and they’re\nmaking their own mother swim for the good of the cause.” Phoebe\nheld out a plump hand, moist and cold from lifting cool crocks of\nmilk, and laughed at her own predicament.\n”The water won’t rise any more, Mother Hart,” Grant called down\nto her from the top step, where he was sitting unblushingly\nbeside Evadna. ”I told you six inches would be the limit, and\nthen it would run oﬀ in the new ditch. You know I explained\njust why–”\n”Oh, yes, I know you explained just WHY,” Phoebe cut in\ndisconsolately and yet humorously, ”but explanations don’t seem\nto help my poor milk-house any. And what about the garden, and\nthe fruit, if you turn tho water all down into the pasture? And\nwhat about the poor horses getting their feet wet and catching\ntheir death of cold? And what’s to hinder that man Stanley and\nhis gang from packing water in buckets from the lake you’re going\nto have in the pasture?”\nShe looked at Miss Georgie whimsically. ”I’m an ungrateful,\nbad-tempered old woman, I guess, for they’re doing it because\nit’s the only thing they can do, since I put my foot down on all\nthis bombarding and burning good powder just to ease their minds.\nThey’ve got to do something, I suppose, or they’d all burst. And\n145\nI don’t know but what it’s a good thing for ’em to work oﬀ their\nenergy digging ditches, even if it don’t do a mite of good.”\nGood Indian was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees,\nmurmuring lover’s conﬁdences behind the shield of his tilted\nhat, which hid from all but Evadna his smiling lips and his\ntelltale, glowing eyes. He looked up at that last sentence,\nthough it is doubtful if he had heard much of what she had been\nsaying.\n”It’s bound to do good if it does anything,” he said. with an\noptimism which was largely the outgrowth of his beatiﬁc mood,\nwhich in its turn was born of his nearness to Evadna and her\ngracious manner toward him. ”We promised not to molest them on\ntheir claims. But if they get over the line to meddle with our\nwater system, or carry any in buckets–which they can’t, because\nthey all leak like the deuce”–he grinned as he thought of the\nbullet holes in them–”why, I don’t know but what someone might\nobject to that, and send them back on their own side of the\nline.”\nHe picked up a ﬂoating ribbon-end which was a part of Evadna’s\nbelt, and ran it caressingly through his ﬁngers in a way which\nset Miss Georgie’s teeth together. ”I’m afraid,” he added dryly,\nhis eyes once more seeking Evadna’s face with pure love hunger,\n”they aren’t going to make much of a stagger at placer mining, if\nthey haven’t any water.” He rolled the ribbon up tightly, and\nthen tossed it lightly toward her face. ”ARE they, Goldilocks?”\n”Are they what? I’ve told you a dozen times to stop calling me\nthat. I had a doll once that I named Goldilocks, and I melted\nher nose oﬀ–she was wax–and you always remind me of the\nhorrible expression it gave to her face. I’d go every day and\ntake her out of the bureau-drawer and look at her, and then cry\nmy eyes out. Won’t you come and sit down, Georgie? There’s\nroom. Now, what was the discussion, and how far had we got?\nAunt Phoebe, I don’t believe it has raised a bit lately. I’ve\nbeen watching that black rock with the crack in it.” Evadna\nmoved nearer to Good Indian, and pulled her skirts close upon the\nother side, thereby making a space at least eight inches wide for\nMiss Georgie’s accommodation.\n”I can’t sit anywhere,” said Miss Georgie, looking at her watch.\n”By the way, chicken, did you have to walk all the way home?”\nEvadna looked sidelong at Good Indian, as if a secret had been\nbetrayed.” No,” she said, ”I didn’t. I just got to the top of\nthe grade when a squaw came along, and she was leading\nHuckleberry. A gaudy young squaw, all red and purple and yellow.\nShe was awfully curious about you, Grant. She wanted to know\n146\nwhere you were and what you were doing. I hope you aren’t a\nﬂirtatious young man. She seemed to know you pretty well, I\nthought.”\nShe had to explain to her Aunt Phoebe and Grant just how she\ncame to be walking, and she laughed at the squaw’s vivid\ncostume, and declared she would have one like it, because Grant\nmust certainly admire colors. She managed, innocently enough, to\nwaste upon such trivialities many of Miss Georgie’s precious\nminutes.\nAt last that young woman, after glancing many times at her watch,\nand declining an urgent invitation to stay to supper, declared\nthat she must go, and tried to give Good Indian a signiﬁcant\nlook without being detected in the act by Evadna. But Good\nIndian, for the time being wholly absorbed by the smiles of his\nlady, had no eyes for her, and seemed to attach no especial\nmeaning to her visit. So that Miss Georgie, feminine to her\nﬁnger-tips and oversensitive perhaps where those two were\nconcerned, suddenly abandoned her real object in going to the\nranch, and rode away without saying a word of what she had come\nto say.\nShe was a direct young woman who was not in the habit of mincing\nmatters with herself, or of dodging an issue, and she bluntly\ncalled herself a fool many times that evening, because she had\nnot said plainly that she would like to talk with Grant ”and\ntaken him oﬀ to one side–by the ear, if necessary–and talked\nto him, and told him what I went down there to tell him,” she\nsaid to herself angrily. ”And if Evadna didn’t like it, she\ncould do the other thing. It does seem as if girls like that are\nalways having the trail smoothed down for them to dance their\nway through life, while other people climb over rocks–mostly\nwith packs on their shoulders that don’t rightly belong to them.”\nShe sighed impatiently. ”It must be lovely to be absolutely\nselﬁsh–when you’re pretty enough and young enough to make it\nstick!” Miss Georgie was, without doubt, in a nasty temper that\nnight.\nCHAPTER XXI\nSOMEBODY SHOT SAUNDERS\nThe hot days dropped, one by one, into the past like ﬁery beads\nupon a velvety black cord. Miss Georgie told them silently in\nthe meager little oﬃce, and sighed as they slipped from under\n147\nher white, nervous ﬁngers. One–nothing happened that could be\nsaid to bear upon the one big subject in her mind, the routine\nwork of passing trains and dribbling business in the express and\nfreight departments, and a long afternoon of heat and silence\nsave for the asthmatic pump, ﬁfty yards down the main track.\nTwo–this exactly like the ﬁrst, except that those inseparables,\nHagar, Viney, and Lucy, whom Miss Georgie had inelegantly dubbed\n”the Three Greases,” appeared, silent, blanket-enshrouded, and\nperspiring, at the oﬃce door in mid-afternoon. Half a box of\nsoggy chocolates which the heat had rendered a dismally sticky\nmass won from them smiles and half-intelligible speech. Fishing\nwas poor–no ketchum. Three–not even the diversion of the\nsquaws to make her forget the dragging hours.\nNothing–nothing–nothing, she told herself apathetically when\nthat third day had slipped upon the black cord of a soft, warm\nnight, star-sprinkled and unutterably lonely as it brooded over\nthe desert.\nOn the morning of the fourth day, Miss Georgie woke with the\nvague sense that something had gone wrong. True railroader as\nshe had come to be, she thought ﬁrst that there had been a\nwreck, and that she was wanted at the telegraph instrument. She\nwas up and partly dressed before the steps and the voices which\nhad broken her sleep had reached her door.\nPete Hamilton’s voice, trembling with excitement, called to her.\n”What is it? What has happened?” she cried from within, beset by\na hundred wild conjectures.\n”Saunders–somebody shot Saunders. Wire for a doctor, quick as\nyuh can. He ain’t dead yet–but he’s goin’ t’ die, sure. Hurry\nup and wire–” Somebody at the store called to him, and he broke\noﬀ to run lumberingly in answer to the summons. Miss Georgie\nmade haste to follow him.\nSaunders was lying upon a blanket on the store platform, and Miss\nGeorgie shuddered as she looked at him.\nHe was pasty white, and his eyes looked glassy under his\nhalf-closed lids. He had been shot in the side– at the stable,\nhe had gasped out when Pete found him lying in the trail just\nback of the store. Now he seemed beyond speech, and the little\ngroup of section-hands, the Chinese cook at the section-house,\nand the Swede foreman, and Pete seemed quite at a loss what to\ndo.\n”Take him in and put him to bed,” Miss Georgie commanded, turning\naway. ”See if he’s bleeding yet, and–well, I should put a cold\ncompress on the wound, I think. I’ll send for a doctor–but he\n148\ncan’t get here till nine o’clock unless you want to stand the\nexpense of a special. And by that time–”\nSaunders moved his head a triﬂe, and lifted his heavy lids to\nlook at her, which so unnerved Miss Georgie that she turned and\nran to the oﬃce. When she had sent the message she sat\ndrumming upon the table while she waited for an answer.\n”G-r-a-n-” her ﬁngers had spelled when she became conscious of\nthe fact, ﬂushed hotly, and folded her hands tightly together in\nher lap.\n”The doctor will come–Hawkinson, I sent for,” she announced\nlater to Pete, holding out the telegram. She glanced reluctantly\nat the wrinkled blanket where Saunders had lain, caught a corner\nof her under lip between her teeth, and, bareheaded though she\nwas, went down the steps and along the trail to the stable.\n”I’ve nearly an hour before I need open the oﬃce,” she said to\nherself, looking at her watch. She did not say what she meant to\ndo with that hour, but she spent a quarter of it examining the\nstable and everything in it. Especially did she search the\nloose, sandy soil in its vicinity for tracks.\nFinally she lifted her skirts as a woman instinctively does at a\nstreet crossing, and struck oﬀ through the sagebrush, her eyes\nupon a line of uncertain footsteps as of a drunken man reeling\nthat way. They were not easy to follow–or they would not have\nbeen if she had not felt certain of the general direction which\nthey must take. More than once she lost sight of them for\nseveral rods, but she always picked them up farther along. At\none place she stopped, and stood perfectly still, her skirts held\nback tightly with both hands, while she stared fascinatedly at a\nred smear upon a broken branch of sage and the smooth-packed\nhollow in the sand where he must have lain.\n”He’s got nerve–I’ll say that much for him,” she observed aloud,\nand went on.\nThe footprints were plain where he crossed the grade road near\nthe edge of the bluﬀ, but from there on it was harder to follow\nthem because of the great patches of black lava rock lying even\nwith the surface of the ground, where a dozen men might walk\nabreast and leave no sign that the untrained eye, at least, could\ndetect.\n”This is a case for Indians,” she mused, frowning over an open\nspace where all was rock. ”Injun Charlie would hunt tracks all\nday for a dollar or two; only he’d make tracks just to prove\nhimself the real goods.” She sighed, stood upon her tiptoes, and\n149\npeered out over the sage to get her bearings, then started on at\na hazard. She went a few rods, found herself in a thick tangle\nof brush through which she could not force her way, started to\nback out, and caught her hair on a scraggly scrub which seemed to\nhave as many prongs as there are briers on a rosebush. She was\nstruggling there with her hands fumbling unavailingly at the back\nof her bowed head, when she was pounced upon by someone or\nsomething through the sage. She screamed.\n”The–deuce!” Good Indian brought out the milder expletive with\nthe ﬂat intonation which the unexpected presence of a lady\nfrequently gives to a man’s speech. ”Lucky I didn’t take a shot\nat you through the bushes. I did, almost, when I saw somebody\nmoving here. Is this your favorite place for a morning ramble?”\nHe had one hand still upon her arm, and he was laughing openly at\nher plight. But he sobered when he stooped a little so that he\ncould see her face, for there were tears in her eyes, and Miss\nGeorgie was not the sort of young woman whom one expects to shed\ntears for slight cause.\n”If you did it–and you must have–I don’t see how you can laugh\nabout it, even if he is a crawling reptile of a man that ought to\nbe hung!” The tears were in her voice as well as her eyes, and\nthere were reproach and disappointment also.\n”Did what–to whom–to where, to why?” Good Indian let go her\narm, and began helpfully striving with the scraggly scrub and its\nprongs. ”Say, I’ll just about have to scalp you to get you\nloose. Would you mind very much, Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ?” He ducked\nand peered into her face again, and again his face sobered.\n”What’s the matter?” he asked, in an entirely diﬀerent\ntone–which Miss Georgie, in spite of her mood, found less\nsatisfying than his banter.\n”Saunders–OUCH; I’d as soon be scalped and done with, as to have\nyou pull out a hair at a time–Saunders crawled home with a\nbullet in his ribs. And I thought–”\n”Saunders!” Good Indian stared down at her, his hands dropped\nupon her head.\nMiss Georgie reached up, caught him by the wrists, and held him\nso while she tilted her head that she might look up at him.\n”Grant!” she cried softly. ”He deserved it. You couldn’t help\nit–he would have shot you down like a dog, just because he was\nhired to do it, or because of some hold over him. Don’t think I\nblame you–or that anyone would if they knew the truth. I came\nout to see–I just HAD to make sure–but you must get away from\nhere. You shouldn’t have stayed so long–” Miss Georgie gave a\n150\nmost unexpected sob, and stopped that she might grit her teeth in\nanger over it.\n”You think I shot him.” As Good Indian said it, the sentence was\nmerely a statement, rather than an accusation or a reproach.\n”I don’t blame you. I suspected he was the man up here with the\nriﬂe. That day–that ﬁrst day, when you told me about someone\nshooting at you–he came over to the station. And I saw two or\nthree scraps of sage sticking under his shirt-collar, as if he\nhad been out in the brush; you know how it breaks oﬀ and sticks,\nwhen you go through it. And he said he had been asleep. And\nthere isn’t any sage where a man would have to go through it\nunless he got right out in it, away from the trails. I thought\nthen that he was the man–”\n”You didn’t tell me.” And this time he spoke reproachfully.\n”It was after you had left that I saw it. And I did go down to\nthe ranch to tell you. But I–you were so–occupied–in other\ndirections–” She let go his wrists, and began fumbling at her\nhair, and she bowed her head again so that her face was hidden\nfrom him.\n”You could have told me, anyway,” Good Indian said constrainedly.\n”You didn’t want her to know. I couldn’t, before her. And I\ndidn’t want to–hurt her by–” Miss Georgie fumbled more with her\nwords than with her hair.\n”Well, there’s no use arguing about that.” Good Indian also\nfound that subject a diﬃcult one. ”You say he was shot. Did\nhe say–”\n”He wasn’t able to talk when I saw him. Pete said Saunders\nclaimed he was shot at the stable, but I know that to be a lie.”\nMiss Georgie spoke with unfeeling exactness. ”That was to save\nhimself in case he got well, I suppose. I believe the man is\ngoing to die, if he hasn’t already; he had the look–I’ve seen\nthem in wrecks, and I know. He won’t talk; he can’t. But\nthere’ll be an investigation–and Baumberger, I suspect, will be\njust as willing to get you in this way as in any other. More so,\nmaybe. Because a murder is always awkward to handle.”\n”I can’t see why he should want to murder me.” Good Indian took\nher hands away from her hair, and set himself again to the work\nof freeing her. ”You’ve been fudging around till you’ve got\nabout ten million more hairs wound up,” he grumbled.\n”Wow! ARE you deliberately torturing me?” she complained, winking\n151\nwith the pain of his good intentions. ”I don’t believe he does\nwant to murder you. I think that was just Saunders trying to\nmake a dandy good job of it. He doesn’t like you,\nanyway–witness the way you bawled him out that day you\nroped–ow-w!–roped the dog. Baumberger may have wanted him to\nkeep an eye on you–My Heavens, man! Do you think you’re plucking\na goose?”\n”I wouldn’t be surprised,” he retorted, grinning a little.\n”Honest! I’m trying to go easy, but this infernal bush has sure\ngot a strangle hold on you–and your hair is so ﬂuﬀy it’s a\ndeuce of a job. You keep wriggling and getting it caught in new\nplaces. If you could only manage to stand still–but I suppose\nyou can’t.\n”By the way,” he remarked casually, after a short silence, save\nfor an occasional squeal from Miss Georgie, ”speaking of\nSaunders–I didn’t shoot him.”\nMiss Georgie looked up at him, to the further entanglement of her\nhair. ”You DIDN’T? Then who did?”\n”Search ME,” he oﬀered ﬁguratively and brieﬂy.\n”Well, I will.” Miss Georgie spoke with a certain decisiveness,\nand reaching out a sage-soiled hand, took his gun from the\nholster at his hip. He shrank away with a man’s instinctive\ndislike of having anyone make free with his weapons, but it was\na single movement, which he controlled instantly.\n”Stand still, can’t you?” he admonished, and kept at work while\nshe examined the gun with a dexterity and ease of every motion\nwhich betrayed her perfect familiarity with ﬁrearms. She\nsnapped the cylinder into place, sniﬀed daintily at the end of\nthe barrel, and slipped the gun back into its scabbard.\n”Don’t think I doubted your word,” she said, casting a slanting\nglance up at him without moving her head. ”But I wanted to be\nable to swear positively, if I should happen to be dragged into\nthe witness-box–I hope it won’t be by the hair of the\nhead!–that your gun has not been ﬁred this morning. Unless you\ncarry a cleaning rod with you,” she added, ”which would hardly be\nlikely.”\n”You may search me if you like,” Good Indian suggested, and for\nan engaged young man, and one deeply in love withal, he displayed\na contentment with the situation which was almost reprehensible.\n”No use. If you did pack one with you, you’d be a fool not to\nthrow it away after you had used it. No, I’ll swear to the gun\n152\nas it is now. Are you ever going to get my hair loose? I’m due\nat the oﬃce right this minute, I’ll bet a molasses cooky.” She\nlooked at her watch, and groaned. ”I’d have to telegraph myself\nback to get there on time now,” she said. ”Twenty-four–that\nfast freight–is due in eighteen minutes exactly. I’ve got to be\nthere. Take your jackknife and cut what won’t come loose.\nReally, I mean it, Mr. Imsen.”\n”I was under the impression that my name is Grant–to friends.”\n”My name is ’Dennis,’ if I don’t beat that freight,” she retorted\ncurtly. ”Take your knife and give me a hair cut–quick! I can do\nit a diﬀerent way, and cover up the place.”\n”Oh, all right–but it’s a shame to leave a nice bunch of hair\nlike this hanging on a bush.”\n”Tell me, what were you doing up here, Grant? And what are you\ngoing to do now? We haven’t much time, and we’ve been fooling\nwhen we should have been discussing ’ways and means.’”\n”Well, I got up early, and someone took a shot at me again. This\ntime he clipped my hat-brim.” He took oﬀ his hat, and showed\nher where the brim had a jagged tear half an inch deep. ”I\nducked, and made up my mind I’d get him this time, or know the\nreason why. So I rode up the other way and back behind the\norchard, and struck the grade below the Point o’ Rocks, and so\ncame up here hunting him. I kept pretty well out of sight–we’ve\ndone that before; Jack and I took sneak yesterday, and came up\nhere at sunrise, but we couldn’t ﬁnd anything. I was beginning\nto think he had given it up. So I was just scouting around here\nwhen I heard you rustling the bushes over here. I was going to\nshoot, but I changed my mind, and thought I’d land on you and\ntrust to the lessons I got in football and the gun. And the\nrest,” he declaimed whimsically, ”you know.\n”Now, duck away down–oh, wait a minute.” He gave a jerk at the\nknot of his neckerchief, ﬂipped out the folds, spread it\ncarefully over her head, and tied it under her chin, patting it\ninto place and tucking stray locks under as if he rather enjoyed\ndoing it.” Better wear it till you’re out of the brush,” he\nadvised, ”if you don’t want to get hung up somewhere again.”\nShe stood up straight, with a long, deep sigh of relief.\n”Now, pikeway,” he smiled. ”And don’t run bareheaded through the\nbushes again. You’ve still got time to beat that train.\nAnd–about Saunders– don’t worry. I can get to the ranch\nwithout being seen, and no one will know I was up here, unless\nyou tell them.”\n153\n”Oh, I shall of course!” Miss Georgie chose to be very sarcastic.\n”I think I shall wire the information to the sheriﬀ. Don’t come\nwith me–and leave tracks all over the country. Keep on the\nlava rock. Haven’t you got any sense at all?”\n”You made tracks yourself, madam, and you’ve left a ﬁne lot of\nincriminating evidence on that bush. I’ll have to waste an hour\npicking oﬀ the hair, so they won’t accuse you of shooting\nSaunders.” Good Indian spoke lightly, but they both stopped,\nnevertheless, and eyed the oﬀending bush anxiously.\n”You haven’t time,” Miss Georgie decided. ”I can easily get\naround that, if it’s put up to me. You go on back. Really, you\nmust!” her eyes implored him.\n”Oh, vey-ree well. We haven’t met this morning. Good-by,\nSquaw-talk-far-oﬀ. I’ll see you later, perhaps.”\nMiss Georgie still had that freight heavy on her conscience, but\nshe stood and watched him stoop under an overhanging branch and\nturn his head to smile reassuringly back at her; then, with a\npungent stirring of sage odors, the bushes closed in behind him,\nand it was as if he had never been there at all. Whereupon Miss\nGeorgie once more gathered her skirts together and ran to the\ntrail, and down that to the station.\nShe met a group of squaws, who eyed her curiously, but she was\nlooking once more at her watch, and paid no attention, although\nthey stood huddled in the trail staring after her. She\nremembered that she had left the oﬃce unlocked and she rushed\nin, and sank panting into the chair before her telegraph table\njust as the smoke of the fast freight swirled around the nose of\nthe low, sage-covered hill to the west.\nCHAPTER XXII\nA BIT OF PAPER\nGood Indian came out upon the rim-rock, looked down upon the\nranch beneath him, and knew, by various little movements about\nthe place, that breakfast was not yet ready. Gene was carrying\ntwo pails of milk to the house, and Wally and Jack were watering\nthe horses that had been stabled overnight. He was on the point\nof shouting down to them when his arm was caught tightly from\nbehind. He wheeled about and confronted Rachel. Clothed all in\n154\ndull gray she was, like a savage young Quakeress. Even the red\nribbons were gone from her hair, which was covered by the gray\nblanket wrapped tightly around her slim body. She drew him back\nfrom the rim of the bluﬀ.\n”You no shout,” she murmured gravely. ”No lettum see you here.\nYou go quick. Ketchum you cayuse, go to ranch. You no tellum\nyou be this place.”\nGood Indian stood still, and looked at her. She stood with her\narms folded in her blanket, regarding him with a certain yearning\nsteadfastness.\n”You all time think why,” she said, shrewdly reading his\nthoughts, ”I no take shame. I glad.” She ﬂushed, and looked\naway to the far side of the Snake. ”Bad mans no more try for\nshoot you, mebbyso. I heap–”\nGood Indian reached out, and caught her by both shoulders.\n”Rachel–if you did that, don’t tell me about it. Don’t tell me\nanything. I don’t ask you–I don’t want to know.” He spoke\nrapidly, in the grip of his ﬁrst impulse to shield her from what\nshe had done. But he felt her begin to tremble under his\nﬁngers, and he stopped as suddenly as he had begun.\n”You no glad? You think shame for me? You think I–all\ntime–very–bad!” Tragedy was in her voice, and in her great,\ndark eyes. Good Indian gulped.\n”No, Rachel. I don’t think that. I want to help you out of\nthis, if I can, and I meant that if you didn’t tell me anything\nabout it, why–I wouldn’t know anything about it. You sabe.”\n”I sabe.” Her lips curved into a pathetic little smile. ”I sabe\nyou know all what I do. You know for why, me thinkum. You think\nshame. I no take shame. I do for you no get kill-dead. All\ntime Man-that-coughs try for shootum you. All time I try for–”\nShe broke oﬀ to stare questioningly up into his face. ”I no\ntell, you no like for tell,” she said quietly. ”All same, you\ngo. You ketchum you hoss, you go ranch. I think sheriﬀ mans\nmebbyso come pretty quick. No ﬁnd out you be here. I no like\nyou be here this time.”\nGood Indian turned, yielding to the pleading of her eyes. The\nheart of him ached dully with the weight of what she had done,\nand with an uneasy comprehension of her reason for doing it. He\nwalked as quickly as the rough ground would permit, along the\nbluﬀ toward the grade; and she, with the instinctive deference\nto the male which is the heritage of primitive woman, followed\n155\nsoft-footedly two paces behind him. Once where the way was clear\nhe stopped, and waited for her to come alongside, but Rachel\nstopped and waited also, her eyes hungrily searching his face\nwith the look a dog has for his master. Good Indian read the\nmeaning of that look, and went on, and turned no more toward her\nuntil he reached his horse.\n”You’d better go on to camp, and stay there, Rachel,” he said, as\ncasually as he could. ”No trouble will come to you.” He\nhesitated, biting his lip and plucking absently the tangles from\nthe forelock of his horse. ”You sabe grateful?” he asked\nﬁnally. And when she gave a quick little nod, he went on:\n”Well, I’m grateful to you. You did what a man would do for his\nfriend. I sabe. I’m heap grateful, and I’ll not forget it. All\ntime I’ll be your friend. Good–by.” He mounted, and rode away.\nHe felt, just then, that it was the kindest thing he could do.\nHe looked back once, just as he was turning into the grade road.\nShe was standing, her arms folded in her gray blanket, where he\nhad left her. His ﬁngers tightened involuntarily the reins, so\nthat Keno stopped and eyed his master inquiringly. But there was\nnothing that he might say to her. It was not words that she\nwanted. He swung his heels against Keno’s ﬂanks, and rode home.\nEvadna rallied him upon his moodiness at breakfast, pouted a\nlittle because he remained preoccupied under her teasing, and\nlater was deeply oﬀended because he would not tell her where he\nhad been, or what was worrying him.\n”I guess you better send word to the doctor he needn’t come,” the\npump man put his head in at the oﬃce door to say, just as the\nfreight was pulling away from the water-tank. ”Saunders died a\nfew minutes ago. Pete says you better notify the coroner–and I\nreckon the sheriﬀ, too. Pretty tough to be shot down like that\nin broad daylight.”\n”I think I’d rather be shot in daylight than in the dark,” Miss\nGeorgie snapped unreasonably because her nerves were all\na-jangle, and sent the messages as requested.\nSaunders was neither a popular nor a prominent citizen, and there\nwas none to mourn beside him. Peter Hamilton, as his employer\nand a man whose emotions were easily stirred, was shocked a shade\nlighter as to his complexion and a tone lower as to his voice\nperhaps, and was heard to remark frequently that it was ”a\nturrible thing,” but the chief emotion which the tragedy roused\nwas curiosity, and that ﬂuttering excitement which attends death\nin any form.\nA dozen Indians hung about the store, the squaws peering\n156\ninquisitively in at the uncurtained window of the lean-to–where\nthe bed held a long immovable burden with a rumpled sheet over\nit–and the bucks listening stolidly to the futile gossip on the\nstore porch.\nPete Hamilton, anxious that the passing of his unproﬁtable\nservant should be marked by decorum if not by grief, mentally\nclassed the event with election day, in that he refused to sell\nany liquor until the sheriﬀ and coroner arrived. He also, after\nhis ﬁrst bewilderment had passed, conceived the idea that\nSaunders had committed suicide, and explained to everyone who\nwould listen just why he believed it. Saunders was sickly, for\none thing. For another, Saunders never seemed to get any good\nout of living. He had read everything he could get his hands\non–and though Pete did not say that Saunders chose to die when\nthe stock of paper novels was exhausted, he left that impression\nupon his auditors.\nThe sheriﬀ and the coroner came at nine. All the Hart boys,\nincluding Donny, were there before noon, and the group of Indians\nremained all day wherever the store cast its shadow. Squaws and\nbucks passed and repassed upon the footpath between Hartley and\ntheir camp, chattering together of the big event until they came\nunder the eye of strange white men, whereupon they. were\nstricken deaf and dumb, as is the way of our nation’s wards.\nWhen the sheriﬀ inspected the stable and its vicinity, looking\nfor clews, not a blanket was in sight, though a dozen eyes\nwatched every movement suspiciously. When at the inquest that\nafternoon, he laid upon the table a battered old revolver of\ncheap workmanship and long past its prime, and testiﬁed that he\nhad found it ten feet from the stable-door, in a due line\nsoutheast from the hay-corral, and that one shot had been ﬁred\nfrom it, there were Indians in plenty to glance furtively at the\nweapon and give no sign.\nThe coroner showed the bullet which he had extracted from the\nbody of Saunders, and ﬁtted it into the empty cartridge which\nhad been under the hammer in the revolver, and thereby proved to\nthe satisfaction of everyone that the gun was intimately\nconnected with the death of the man. So the jury arrived\nspeedily, and without further fussing over evidence, at the\nverdict of suicide.\nGood Indian drew a long breath, put on his hat, and went over to\ntell Miss Georgie. The Hart boys lingered for a few minutes at\nthe store, and then rode on to the ranch without him, and the\nIndians stole away over the hill to their camp. The coroner and\nthe sheriﬀ accepted Pete’s invitation into the back part of the\nstore, refreshed themselves after the ordeal, and caught the next\n157\ntrain for Shoshone. So closed the incident of Saunders’ passing,\nso far as the law was concerned.\n”Well,” Miss Georgie summed up the situation, ”Baumberger hasn’t\nmade any sign of taking up the matter. I don’t believe, now,\nthat he will. I wired the news to the papers in Shoshone, so he\nmust know. I think perhaps he’s glad to get Saunders out of the\nway–for he certainly must have known enough to put Baumberger\nbehind the bars.\n”But I don’t see,” she said, in a puzzled way, ”how that gun came\nonto the scene. I looked all around the stable this morning, and\nI could swear there wasn’t any gun.”\n”Well, he did pick it up–fortunately,” Good Indian returned\ngrimly. ”I’m glad the thing was settled so easily.”\nShe looked up at him sharply for a moment, opened her lips to ask\na question, and then thought better of it.\n”Oh, here’s your handkerchief,” she said quietly, taking it from\nthe bottom of her wastebasket. ”As you say, the thing is\nsettled. I’m going to turn you out now. The four-thirty-ﬁve is\ndue pretty soon–and I have oodles of work.”\nHe looked at her strangely, and went away, wondering why Miss\nGeorgie hated so to have him in the oﬃce lately.\nOn the next day, at ten o’clock, they buried Saunders on a\ncertain little knoll among the sagebrush; buried him without much\nceremony, it is true, but with more respect than he had received\nwhen he was alive and shambling sneakily among them. Good Indian\nwas there, saying little and listening attentively to the\ncomments made upon the subject, and when the last bit of yellow\ngravel had been spatted into place he rode down through the\nIndian camp on his way home, thankful that everyone seemed to\naccept the verdict of suicide as being ﬁnal, and anxious that\nRachel should know it. He felt rather queer about Rachel; sorry\nfor her, in an impersonal way; curious over her attitude toward\nlife in general and toward himself in particular, and ready to do\nher a good turn because of her interest.\nBut Rachel, when he reached the camp, was not visible. Peppajee\nJim was sitting peacefully in the shade of his wikiup when Grant\nrode up, and he merely grunted in reply to a question or two.\nGood Indian resolved to be patient. He dismounted, and squatted\nupon his heels beside Peppajee, oﬀered him tobacco, and dipped a\nshiny, new nickel toward a bright-eyed papoose in scanty raiment,\nwho stopped to regard him inquisitively.\n158\n”I just saw them bury Saunders,” Good Indian remarked, by way of\nopening a conversation. ”You believe he shot himself?”\nPeppajee took his little stone pipe from his lips, blew a thin\nwreath of smoke, and replaced the stem between his teeth, stared\nstolidly straight ahead of him, and said nothing.\n”All the white men say that,” Good Indian persisted, after he had\nwaited a minute. Peppajee did not seem to hear.\n”Sheriﬀ say that, too. Sheriﬀ found the gun.”\n”Mebbyso sheriﬀ mans heap damfool. Mebbyso heap smart. No\nsabe.”\nGood Indian studied him silently. Reticence was not a general\ncharacteristic of Peppajee; it seemed to indicate a thorough\nunderstanding of the whole aﬀair. He wondered if Rachel had\ntold her uncle the truth.\n”Where’s Rachel?” he asked suddenly, the words following\ninvoluntarily his thought.\nPeppajee sucked hard upon his pipe, took it away from his mouth,\nand knocked out the ashes upon a pole of the wikiup frame.\n”Yo’ no speakum Rachel no more,” he said gravely. ”Yo’ ketchum\n’Vadnah; no ketchum otha squaw. Bad medicine come. Heap much\ntroubles come. Me no likeum. My heart heap bad.”\n”I’m Rachel’s friend, Peppajee.” Good Indian spoke softly so\nthat others might not hear. ”I sabe what Rachel do. Rachel good\ngirl. I don’t want to bring trouble. I want to help.”\nPeppajee snorted.\n”Yo’ make heap bad heart for Rachel,” he said sourly. ”Yo’ like\nfor be friend, yo’ no come no more, mebbyso. No speakum. Bimeby\nmebbyso no have bad heart no more. Kay bueno. Yo’ white mans.\nRachel mebbyso thinkum all time yo’ Indian. Mebbyso thinkum be\nyo’ squaw. Kay bueno. Yo’ all time white mans. No speakum\nRachel no more, yo’ be friend.\nYo’ speakum, me like to kill yo’, mebbyso.” He spoke calmly, but\nnone the less his words carried conviction of his sincerity.\nWithin the wikiup Good Indian heard a smothered sob. He\nlistened, heard it again, and looked challengingly at Peppajee.\nBut Peppajee gave no sign that he either heard the sound or saw\n159\nthe challenge in Good Indian’s eyes.\n”I Rachel’s friend,” he said, speaking distinctly with his face\nhalf turned toward the wall of deerskin. ”I want to tell Rachel\nwhat the sheriﬀ said. I want to thank Rachel, and tell her I’m\nher friend. I don’t want to bring trouble.” He stopped and\nlistened, but there was no sound within.\nPeppajee eyed him comprehendingly, but there was no yielding in\nhis brown, wrinkled face.\n”Yo’ Rachel’s frien’, yo’ pikeway,” he insisted doggedly.\nFrom under the wall of the wikiup close to Good Indian on the\nside farthest from Peppajee, a small, leaﬂess branch of sage was\nthrust out, and waggled cautiously, scraping gently his hand.\nGood Indian’s ﬁngers closed upon it instinctively, and felt it\nslowly withdrawn until his hand was pressed against the hide\nwall. Then soft ﬁngers touched his own, ﬂuttered there\ntimidly, and left in his palm a bit of paper, tightly folded.\nGood Indian closed his hand upon it, and stood up.\n”All right, I go,” he said calmly to Peppajee, and mounted.\nPeppajee looked at him stolidly, and said nothing.\n”One thing I would like to know.” Good Indian spoke again. ”You\ndon’t care any more about the men taking Peaceful’s ranch.\nBefore they came, you watch all the time, you heap care. Why you\nno care any more? Why you no help?”\nPeppajee’s mouth straightened in a grin of pure irony.\n”All time Baumberga try for ketchum ranch, me try for stoppum,”\nhe retorted. ”Yo’ no b’lievum, Peacefu’ no b’lievum. Me tellum\nyo’ cloud sign, tellum yo’ smoke sign, tellum yo’ hear much bad\ntalk for ketchum ranch. Yo’ all time think for ketchum ’Vadnah\nsquaw. No think for stoppum mens. Yo’ all time let mens come,\nketchum ranch. Yo’ say ﬁghtum in co’t. Cloud sign say me do\nnotting. Yo’ lettum come. Yo’ mebbyso makum go. Me no care.”\n”I see. Well, maybe you’re right.” He tightened the reins, and\nrode away, the tight little wad of paper still hidden in his\npalm. When he was quite out of sight from the camp and jogging\nleisurely down the hot trail, he unfolded it carefully and looked\nat it long.\nHis face was grave and thoughtful when at last he tore it into\ntiny bits and gave it to the hot, desert wind. It was a pitiful\nlittle message, printed laboriously upon a scrap of brown\n160\nwrapping–paper. It said simply:\n”God by i lov yo.”\nCHAPTER XXIII\nTHE MALICE OF A SQUAW\nGood Indian looked in the hammock, but Evadna was not there. He\nwent to the little stone bench at the head of the pond, and when\nhe still did not see her he followed the bank around to the milk-\nhouse, where was a mumble of voices. And, standing in the\ndoorway with her arm thrown around her Aunt Phoebe’s shoulders in\na pretty protective manner, he saw her, and his eyes gladdened.\nShe did not see him at once. She was facing courageously the\nthree inseparables, Hagar, Viney, and Lucy, squatted at the top\nof the steps, and she was speaking her mind rapidly and angrily.\nGood Indian knew that tone of old, and he grinned. Also he\nstopped by the corner of the house, and listened shamelessly.\n”That is not true,” she was saying very clearly. ”You’re a bad\nold squaw and you tell lies. You ought to be put in jail for\ntalking that way.” She pressed her aunt’s shoulder\naﬀectionately. ”Don’t you mind a word she says, Aunt Phoebe.\nShe’s just a mischief-making old hag, and she–oh, I’d like to\nbeat her!”\nHagar shook her head violently, and her voice rose shrill and\nmalicious, cutting short Evadna’s futile deﬁance.\n”Ka-a-ay bueno, yo’!” Her teeth gnashed together upon the words.\n”I no tellum lie. Good Injun him kill Man-that-coughs. All time\nI seeum creep, creep, through sagebrush. All time I seeum hoss\nwait where much rock grow. I seeum. I no speakum heap lie.\nSpeakum true. I go tell sheriﬀ mans Good Indian killum\nMan-that-coughs. I tellum–”\n”Why didn’t you, then, when the sheriﬀ was in Hartley?” Evadna\nﬂung at her angrily. ”Because you know it’s a lie. That’s\nwhy.”\n”Yo’ thinkum Good Injun love yo’, mebbyso.” Hagar’s witch-grin\nwas at its malevolent widest. Her black eyes sparkled with\nvenom. ”Yo’ heap fool. Good Injun go all time\nSquaw-talk-far-oﬀ. Speakum glad word. Good Injun ka-a-ay\nbueno. Love Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ. No love yo’. Speakum lies,\n161\nyo’. Makum yo’ heap cry all time. Makeum yo’ heart bad.” She\ncackled, and leered with vile signiﬁcance toward the girl in the\ndoorway.\n”Don’t you listen to her, honey.” It was Phoebe’s turn to\nreassure.\nGood Indian took a step forward, his face white with rage. Viney\nsaw him ﬁrst, muttered an Indian word of warning, and the three\nsprang up and backed away from his approach.\n”So you’ve got to call me a murderer!” he cried, advancing\nthreateningly upon Hagar. ”And even that doesn’t satisfy you.\nYou–”\nEvadna rushed up the steps like a crisp little whirlwind, and\ncaught his arm tightly in her two hands.\n”Grant! We don’t believe a word of it. You couldn’t do a thing\nlike that. Don’t we KNOW? Don’t pay any attention to her. We\naren’t going to. It’ll hurt her worse than any kind of\npunishment we could give her. Oh, she’s a VILE old thing! Too\nvile for words! Aunt Phoebe and I shouldn’t belittle ourselves by\neven listening to her. SHE can’t do any harm unless we let it\nbother us–what she says. Iknow you never could take a human\nlife, Grant. It’s foolish even to speak of such a thing. It’s\njust her nasty, lying tongue saying what her black old heart\nwishes could be true.” She was speaking in a torrent of\ntrepidation lest he break from her and do some violence which\nthey would all regret. She did not know what he could do, or\nwould do, but the look of his face frightened her.\nOld Hagar spat viciously at them both, and shrilled vituperative\nsentences–in her own tongue fortunately; else the things she\nsaid must have brought swift retribution. And as if she did not\ncare for consequences and wanted to make her words carry a\ndeﬁnite sting, she stopped, grinned maliciously, and spoke the\nchoppy dialect of her tribe.\n”Yo’ tellum me shont-isham. Mebbyso yo’ tellum yo’ no ketchum\nSquaw-talk-far-oﬀ in sagebrush, all time Saunders go dead! Me\nketchum hair–Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ hair. You like for see, you\nthinkum me tell lies?”\nFrom under her blanket she thrust forth a greasy brown hand, and\nshook triumphantly before them a tangled wisp of woman’s\nhair–the hair of Miss Georgie, without a doubt. There was no\ngainsaying that color and texture. She looked full at Evadna.\n”Yo’ like see, me show whereum walk,” she said grimly. ”Good\n162\nInjun boot make track, Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ little shoe make track.\nMe show, yo’ thinkum mebbyso me tell lie. Stoppum in sagebrush,\nketchum hair. Me ketchum knife–Good Injun knife, mebbyso.”\nRevenge mastered cupidity, and she produced that also, and held\nit up where they could all see.\nEvadna looked and winced.\n”I don’t believe a word you say,” she declared stubbornly. ”You\nSTOLE that knife. I suppose you also stole the hair. You can’t\nMAKE me believe a thing like that!”\n”Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ run, run heap fas’, get home quick. Me\nseeum, Viney seeum, Lucy seeum.” Hagar pointed to each as she\nnamed her, and waited until they give a conﬁrmatory nod. The\ntwo squaws gazed steadily at the ground, and she grunted and\nignored them afterward, content that they bore witness to her\ntruth in that one particular.\n”Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ sabe Good Injun killum Man-that-coughs,\nmebbyso,” she hazarded, watching Good Indian’s face cunningly to\nsee if the guess struck close to the truth.\n”If you’ve said all you want to say, you better go,” Good Indian\ntold her after a moment of silence while they glared at each\nother. ”I won’t touch you–because you’re such a devil I\ncouldn’t stop short of killing you, once I laid my hands on you.”\nHe stopped, held his lips tightly shut upon the curses he would\nnot speak, and Evadna felt his biceps tauten under her ﬁngers as\nif he were gathering himself for a lunge at the old squaw. She\nlooked up beseechingly into his face, and saw that it was sharp\nand stern, as it had been that morning when the men had ﬁrst\nbeen discovered in the orchard. He raised his free arm, and\npointed imperiously to the trail.\n”Pikeway!” he commanded.\nViney and Lucy shrank from the tone of him, and, hiding their\nfaces in a fold of blanket, slunk silently away like dogs that\nhave been whipped and told to go. Even Hagar drew back a pace,\nhardy as was her untamed spirit. She looked at Evadna clinging\nto his arm, her eyes wide and startlingly blue and horriﬁed at\nall she had heard. She laughed then–did Hagar–and waddled\nafter the others, her whole body seeming to radiate contentment\nwith the evil she had wrought.\n”There’s nothing on earth can equal the malice of an old squaw,”\nsaid Phoebe, breaking into the silence which followed. ”I’d hope\nshe don’t go around peddling that story–not that anyone would\n163\nbelieve it, but–”\nGood Indian looked at her, and at Evadna. He opened his lips for\nspeech, and closed them without saying a word. That near he came\nto telling them the truth about meeting Miss Georgie, and\nexplaining about the hair and the knife and the footprints Hagar\nhad prated about. But he thought of Rachel, and knew that he\nwould never tell anyone, not even Evadna. The girl loosened his\narm, and moved toward her aunt.\n”I hate Indians–squaws especially,” she said positively. ”I\nhate the way they look at one with their beady eyes, just like\nsnakes. I believe that horrid old thing lies awake nights just\nthinking up nasty, wicked lies to tell about the people she\ndoesn’t like. I don’t think you ought to ride around alone so\nmuch, Grant; she might murder you. It’s in her to do it, if she\never got the chance.”\n”What do you suppose made her ring Georgie Howard in like that?”\nPhoebe speculated, looking at Grant. ”She must have some grudge\nagainst her, too.”\n”I don’t know why.” Good Indian spoke unguardedly, because he\nwas still thinking of Rachel and those laboriously printed words\nwhich he had scattered afar. ”She’s always giving them candy and\nfruit, whenever they show up at the station.”\n”Oh–h!” Evadna gave the word that peculiar, sliding inﬂection\nof hers which meant so much, and regarded him unwinkingly, with\nher hands clasped behind her.\nGood Indian knew well the meaning of both her tone and her stare,\nbut he only laughed and caught her by the arm.\n”Come on over to the hammock,” he commanded, with all the\narrogance of a lover. ”We’re making that old hag altogether too\nimportant, it seems to me. Come on, Goldilocks–we haven’t had a\nreal satisfying sort of scrap for several thousand years.”\nShe permitted him to lead her to the hammock, and pile three\ncushions behind her head and shoulders–with the dark-blue one on\ntop because her hair looked well against it–and dispose himself\ncomfortably where he could look his ﬁll at her while he swung\nthe hammock gently with his boot-heel, scraping a furrow in the\nsand. But she did not show any dimples, though his eyes and his\nlips smiled together when she looked at him, and when he took up\nher hand and kissed each ﬁnger-tip in turn, she was as passive\nas a doll under the caresses of a child.\n”What’s the matter?” he demanded, when he found that her manner\n164\ndid not soften. ”Worrying still about what that old squaw said?”\n”Not in the slightest.” Evadna’s tone was perfectly\npolite–which was a bad sign.\nGood Indian thought he saw the makings of a quarrel in her\ngeneral attitude, and he thought he might as well get at once to\nthe real root of her resentment.\n”What are you thinking about? Tell me, Goldilocks,” he coaxed,\npushing his own troubles to the back of his mind.\n”Oh, nothing. I was just wondering–though it’s a trivial matter\nwhich is hardly worth mentioning–but I just happened to wonder\nhow you came to know that Georgie Howard is in the habit of\ngiving candy to the squaws–or anything else. I’m sure I\nnever–” She bit her lips as if she regretted having said so\nmuch.\nGood Indian laughed. In truth, he was immensely relieved; he\nhad been afraid she might want him to explain something\nelse–something which he felt he must keep to himself even in the\nface of her anger. But this–he laughed again.\n”That’s easy enough,” he said lightly. ”I’ve seen her do it a\ncouple of times. Maybe Hagar has been keeping an eye on me–I\ndon’t know; anyway, when I’ve had occasion to go to the store or\nto the station, I’ve nearly always seen her hanging around in the\nimmediate vicinity. I went a couple of times to see Miss Georgie\nabout this land business. She’s wise to a lot of law–used to\nhelp her father before he died, it seems. And she has some of\nhis books, I discovered. I wanted to see if there wasn’t some\nmeans of kicking these fellows oﬀ the ranch without making a lot\nmore trouble for old Peaceful. But after I’d read up and talked\nthe thing over with her, we decided that there wasn’t anything to\nbe done till Peaceful comes back, and we know what he’s been\ndoing about it. That’s what’s keeping him, of course.\n”I suppose,” he added, looking at her frankly, ”I should have\nmentioned my going there. But to tell you the truth, I didn’t\nthink anything much about it. It was just business, and when I’m\nwith you, Miss Goldilocks, I like to forget my troubles. You,”\nhe declared, his eyes glowing upon her, ”are the antidote. And\nyou wouldn’t have mo believe you could possibly be jealous!”\n”No,” said Evadna, in a more amiable tone. ”Of course I’m not.\nBut I do think you showed a–well, a lack of conﬁdence in me. I\ndon’t see why Ican’t help you share your troubles. You know I\nwant to. I think you should have told me, and let me help. But\nyou never do. Just for instance–why wouldn’t you tell me\n165\nyesterday where you were before breakfast? I know you were\nSOMEWHERE, because I looked all over the place for you,” she\nargued naively. ”I always want to know where you are, it’s so\nlonesome when I don’t know. And you see–”\nShe was interrupted at that point, which was not strange. The\ninterruption lasted for several minutes, but Evadna was a\npersistent little person. When they came back to mundane\nmatters, she went right on with what she had started out to say.\n”You see, that gave old Hagar a chance to accuse you of–well, of\na MEETING with Georgie. Which I don’t believe, of course.\nStill, it does seem as if you might have told me in the ﬁrst\nplace where you had been, and then I could have shut her up by\nletting her see that I knew all about it. The horrid, mean old\nTHING! To say such things, right to your face! And–Grant, where\nDID she get hold of that knife, do you suppose–and–that–bunch\nof–hair?” She took his hand of her own accord, and patted it,\nand Evadna was not a demonstrative kind of person usually. ”It\nwasn’t just a tangle, like combings,” she went on slowly. ”I\nnoticed particularly. There was a lock as large almost as my\nﬁnger, that looked as if it had been cut oﬀ. And it certainly\nWAS Georgie’s hair.”\n”Georgie’s hair,” Good Indian smilingly asserted, ”doesn’t\ninterest me a little bit. Maybe Hagar scalped Miss Georgie to\nget it. If it had been goldy, I’d have taken it away from her if\nI had to annihilate the whole tribe, but seeing it wasn’t YOUR\nhair–”\nWell, the argument as such was a poor one, to say the least, but\nit had the merit of satisfying Evadna as mere logic could not\nhave done, and seemed to allay as well all the doubt that had\nbeen accumulating for days past in her mind. But an hour spent\nin a hammock in the shadiest part of the grove could not wipe out\nall memory of the past few days, nor quiet the uneasiness which\nhad come to be Good Indian’s portion.\n”I’ve got to go up on the hill again right after dinner,\nSquaw-with-sun-hair,” he told her at last. ”I can’t rest,\nsomehow, as long as those gentlemen are camping down in the\norchard. You won’t mind, will you?” Which shows that the hour\nhad not been spent in quarreling, at all events.\n”Certainly not,” Evadna replied calmly. ”Because I’m going with\nyou. Oh, you needn’t get ready to shake your head! I’m going to\nhelp you, from now on, and talk law and give advice and ’scout\naround,’ as you call it. I couldn’t be easy a minute, with old\nHagar on the warpath the way she is. I’d imagine all sorts of\nthings.”\n166\n”You don’t realize how hot it is,” he discouraged.\n”I can stand it if you can. And I haven’t seen Georgie for DAYS.\nShe must get horribly lonesome, and it’s a perfect SHAME that I\nhaven’t been up there lately. I’m sure she wouldn’t treat ME\nthat way.” Evadna had put on her angelic expression. ”I WOULD\ngo oftener,” she declared virtuously, ”only you boys always go\noﬀ without saying anything about it, and I’m silly about riding\npast that Indian camp alone. That squaw–the one that caught\nHuckleberry the other day, you know–would hardly let go of the\nbridle. I was scared to DEATH, only I wouldn’t let her see. I\nbelieve now she’s in with old Hagar, Grant. She kept asking me\nwhere you were, and looked so–”\n”I think, on the whole, we’d better wait till after supper when\nit’s cooler, Goldenhair,” Good Indian observed, when she\nhesitated over something she had not quite decided to say. ”I\nsuppose I really ought to stay and help the boys with that clover\npatch that Mother Hart is worrying so about. I guess she thinks\nwe’re a lazy bunch, all right, when the old man’s gone. We’ll go\nup this evening, if you like.”\nEvadna eyed him with open suspicion, but if she could read his\nreal meaning from anything in his face or his eyes or his manner,\nshe must have been a very keen observer indeed.\nGood Indian was meditating what he called ”making a sneak.” He\nwanted to have a talk with Miss Georgie himself, and he certainly\ndid not want Evadna, of all people, to hear what he had to say.\nFor just a minute he wished that they had quarreled again. He\nwent down to the stable, started to saddle Keno, and then decided\nthat he would not. After all, Hagar’s gossip could do no real\nharm, he thought, and it could not make much diﬀerence if Miss\nGeorgie did not hear of it immediately.\nCHAPTER XXIV\nPEACEFUL RETURNS\nThat afternoon when the four-thirty-ﬁve rushed in from the\nparched desert and slid to a panting halt beside the station\nplatform, Peaceful Hart emerged from the smoker, descended\nquietly to the blistering planks, and nodded through the open\nwindow to Miss Georgie at her instrument taking train orders.\n167\nBehind him perspired Baumberger, purple from the heat and the\nbeer with which he had sought to allay the discomfort of that\nsearing sunlight.\n”Howdy, Miss Georgie?” he wheezed, as he passed the window.\n”Ever see such hot weather in your life? Inever did.”\nMiss Georgie glanced at him while her ﬁngers rattled her key,\nand it struck her that Baumberger had lost a good deal of his\noily amiability since she saw him last. He looked more ﬂabby\nand loose-lipped than ever, and his leering eyes were streaked\nplainly with the red veins which told of heavy drinking. She\ngave him a nod cool enough to lower the thermometer several\ndegrees, and scribbled away upon the yellow pad under her hand\nas if Baumberger had sunk into the oblivion her temper wished for\nhim. She looked up immediately, however, and leaned forward so\nthat she could see Peaceful just turning to go down the steps.\n”Oh, Mr. Hart! Will you wait a minute?” she called clearly above\nthe puﬃng of the engine. ”I’ve something for you here. Soon\nas I get this train out–” She saw him stop and turn back to the\noﬃce, and let it go at that for the present.\n”I sure have got my nerve,” she observed mentally when the\nconductor had signaled the engineer and swung up the steps of the\nsmoker, and the wheels were beginning to clank. All she had for\nPeaceful Hart in that oﬃce was anxiety over his troubles.\n”Just held him up to pry into his private aﬀairs,” she put it\nbluntly to herself. But she smiled at him brightly, and waited\nuntil Baumberger had gone lumbering with rather uncertain steps\nto the store, where he puﬀed up the steps and sat heavily down\nin the shade where Pete Hamilton was resting after the excitement\nof the past thirty-six hours.\n”I lied to you, Mr. Hart,” she confessed, engagingly. ”I haven’t\na thing for you except a lot of questions, and I simply must ask\nthem or die. I’m not just curious, you know. I’m horribly\nanxious. Won’t you take the seat of honor, please? The ranch\nwon’t run oﬀ if you aren’t there for a few minutes after you had\nexpected to be. I’ve been waiting to have a little talk with\nyou, and I simply couldn’t let the opportunity go by.” She\ntalked fast, but she was thinking faster, and wondering if this\ncalm, white-bearded old man thought her a meddlesome fool.\n”There’s time enough, and it ain’t worth much right now,”\nPeaceful said, sitting down in the beribboned rocker and stroking\nhis beard in his deliberate fashion. ”It seems to be getting the\nfashion to be anxious,” he drawled, and waited placidly for her\nto speak.\n168\n”You just about swear by old Baumberger, don’t you?” she began\npresently, ﬁddling with her lead pencil and going straight to\nthe heart of what she wanted to say.\n”Well, I dunno. I’ve kinda learned to ﬁght shy of swearing by\nanybody, Miss Georgie.” His mild blue eyes settled attentively\nupon her ﬂushed face.\n”That’s some encouragement, anyhow,” she sighed. ”Because he’s\nthe biggest old blackguard in Idaho and more treacherous than any\nIndian ever could be if he tried. I just thought I’d tell you,\nin case you didn’t know it. I’m certain as I can be of anything,\nthat he’s at the bottom of this placer-claim fraud, and he’s just\ndigging your ranch out from under your feet while he wheedles\nyou into thinking he’s looking after your interests. I’ll bet\nyou never got an injunction against those eight men,” she\nhazarded, leaning toward him with her eyes sparkling as the\nsubject absorbed all her thoughts. ”I’ll bet anything he kept\nyou ﬁddling around until those fellows all ﬁled on their\nclaims. And now it’s got to go till the case is ﬁnally settled\nin court, because they are technically within their rights in\nmaking lawful improvements on their claims.\n”Grant,” she said, and her voice nearly betrayed her when she\nspoke his name, ”was sure they faked the gold samples they must\nhave used in ﬁling. We both were sure of it. He and the boys\ntried to catch them at some crooked work, but the nights have\nbeen too dark, for one thing, and they were always on the watch,\nand went up to Shoshone in couples, and there was no telling\nwhich two meant to sneak oﬀ next. So they have all ﬁled, I\nsuppose. I know the whole eight have been up–”\n”Yes, they’ve all ﬁled–twenty acres apiece–the best part of\nthe ranch. There’s a forty runs up over the bluﬀ; the lower\nline takes in the house and barn and down into the garden where\nthe man they call Stanley run his line through the strawberry\npatch. That forty’s mine yet. It’s part uh the homestead. The\nmeadowland is most all included. That was a preemption claim.”\nPeaceful spoke slowly, and there was a note of discouragement in\nhis voice which it hurt Miss Georgie to hear.\n”Well, they’ve got to prove that those claims of theirs are\nlawful, you know. And if you’ve got your patent for the\nhomestead–you have got a patent, haven’t you?” Something in his\nface made her ﬂing in the question.\n”Y-es–or I thought I had one,” he answered dryly. ”It seems now\nthere’s a ﬂaw in it, and it’s got to go back to Washington and\nbe rectiﬁed. It ain’t legal till that’s been done.”\n169\nMiss Georgie half rose from her chair, and dropped back\ndespairingly. ”Who found that mistake?” she demanded.\n”Baumberger?”\n”Y-es, Baumberger. He thought we better go over all the papers\nourselves, so the other side couldn’t spring anything on us\nunawares, and there was one paper that hadn’t been made out\nright. So it had to be ﬁxed, of course. Baumberger was real\nput out about it.”\n”Oh, of course!” Miss Georgie went to the window to make sure of\nthe gentleman’s whereabouts. He was still sitting upon the store\nporch, and he was just in the act of lifting a tall, glass mug of\nbeer to his gross mouth when she looked over at him. ”Pig!” she\ngritted under her breath. ”It’s a pity he doesn’t drink himself\nto death.” She turned and faced Peaceful anxiously.\n”You spoke a while ago as if you didn’t trust him implicitly,”\nshe said. ”I ﬁrmly believe he hired those eight men to ﬁle on\nyour land. I believe he also hired Saunders to watch Grant, for\nsome reason–perhaps because Grant has shown his hostility from\nthe ﬁrst. Did you know Saunders–or someone–has been shooting\nat Grant from the top of the bluﬀ for–well, ever since you\nleft? The last shot clipped his hat-brim. Then Saunders was\nshot–or shot himself, according to the inquest–and there has\nbeen no more riﬂe practice with Grant for the target.”\n”N-no, I hadn’t heard about that.” Peaceful pulled hard at his\nbeard so that his lips were drawn slightly apart. ”I don’t mind\ntelling yuh,” he added slowly, ”that I’ve got another lawyer\nworking on the case–Black. He hates Baumberger, and he’d like\nto git something on him. I don’t want Baumberger should know\nanything about it, though. He takes it for granted I swallow\nwhole everything he says and does–but I don’t. Not by a long\nshot. Black’ll ferret out any crooked work.”\n”He’s a dandy if he catches Baumberger,” Miss Georgie averred,\ngloomily. ”I tried a little detective work on my own account. I\nhadn’t any right; it was about the cipher messages Saunders used\nto send and receive so often before your place was jumped. I was\ndead sure it was old Baumberger at the other end, and I–well, I\nstruck up a mild sort of ﬂirtation with the operator at\nShoshone.” She smiled deprecatingly at Peaceful.\n”I wanted to ﬁnd out–and I did by writing a nice letter or two;\nwe have to be pretty cute about what we send over the wires,” she\nexplained, ”though we do talk back and forth quite a lot, too.\nThere was a news-agent and cigar man–you know that kind of\njoint, where they sell paper novels and magazines and tobacco and\nsuch–getting Saunders’ messages. Jim Wakely is his name. He\n170\ntold the operator that he and Saunders were just practicing; they\nwere going to be detectives, he said, and rigged up a cipher that\nthey were learning together so they wouldn’t need any codebook.\nPretty thin that–but you can’t prove it wasn’t the truth. I\nmanaged to ﬁnd out that Baumberger buys cigars and papers of Jim\nWakely sometimes; not always, though.”\nMiss Georgie laughed ruefully, and patted her pompadour\nabsent-mindedly.\n”So all I got out of that,” she ﬁnished, ”was a correspondence I\ncould very well do without. I’ve been trying to quarrel with\nthat operator ever since, but he’s so darned easy-tempered!” She\nwent and looked out of the window again uneasily.\n”He’s guzzling beer over there, and from the look of him he’s had\na good deal more than he needs already,” she informed Peaceful.\n”He’ll burst if he keeps on. I suppose I shouldn’t keep you any\nlonger–he’s looking this way pretty often, I notice; nothing but\nthe beer-keg holds him, I imagine. And when he empties that–”\nShe shrugged her shoulders, and sat down facing Hart.\n”Maybe you could bribe Jim Wakely into giving something away,”\nshe suggested. ”I’d sure like to see Baumberger stub his toe in\nthis deal! Or maybe you could get around one of those eight\nbeauties you’ve got camping down on your ranch–but there isn’t\nmuch chance of that; he probably took good care to pick clams for\nthat job. And Saunders,” she added slowly, ”is eternally silent.\nWell, I hope in mercy you’ll be able to catch him napping, Mr.\nHart.”\nPeaceful rose stiﬄy,–and took up his hat from where he had\nlaid it on the table.\n”I ain’t as hopeful as I was a week ago,” he admitted mildly.\n”Put if there’s any justice left in the courts, I’ll save the old\nranch. My wife and I worked hard to make it what it is, and my\nboys call it home. We can’t save it by anything but law.\nFightin’ would only make a bad matter worse. I’m obliged to\nyuh, Miss Georgie, for taking such an interest–and I’ll tell\nBlack about Jim Wakely.”\n”Don’t build any hopes on Jim,” she warned. ”He probably doesn’t\nknow anything except that he sent and received messages he\ncouldn’t read any sense into.”\n”Well–there’s always a way out, if we can ﬁnd it. Come down\nand see us some time. We still got a house to invite our friends\nto.” He smiled drearily at her, gave a little, old-fashioned\nbow, and went over to join Baumberger–and to ask Pete Hamilton\n171\nfor the use of his team and buckboard.\nMiss Georgie, keeping an uneasy vigil over everything that moved\nin the barren portion of Hartley which her window commanded, saw\nPete get up and start listlessly toward the stable; saw Peaceful\nsit down to wait; and then Pete drove up with the rig, and they\nstarted for the ranch. She turned with a startled movement to\nthe oﬃce door, because she felt that she was being watched.\n”How, Hagar, and Viney, and Lucy,” she greeted languidly when she\nsaw the three squaws sidle closer, and reached for a bag of candy\nfor them.\nHagar’s greasy paw stretched out greedily for the gift, and\nplaced it in jealous hiding beneath her blanket, but she did not\nturn to go, as she most frequently did after getting what she\ncame for. Instead, she waddled boldly into the oﬃce, her eyes\nsearching cunningly every corner of the little room. Viney and\nLucy remained outside, passively waiting. Hagar twitched at\nsomething under her blanket, and held out her hand again; this\ntime it was not empty.\n”Ketchum sagebrush,” she announced laconically. ”Mebbyso yo’\nlike for buy?”\nMiss Georgie stared ﬁxedly at the hand, and said nothing. Hagar\ndrew it under her blanket, held it fumbling there, and thrust it\nforth again.\n”Ketchum where ketchum hair,” she said, and her wicked old eyes\ntwinkled with malice. ”Mebbyso yo’ like for buy?”\nMiss Georgie still stared, and said nothing. Her under lip was\ncaught tightly between her teeth by now, and her eyebrows were\npulled close together.\n”Ketchum much track, same place,” said Hagar grimly. ”Good Injun\nmakeum track all same boot. Seeum Good Injun creep, creep in\nbushes, all time Man-that-coughs be heap kill. Yo’ buy hair, buy\nknife, mebbyso me no tell me seeum Good Injun. Me tell, Good\nInjun go for jail; mebbyso killum rope.” She made a horrible\ngesture of hanging by the neck. Afterward she grinned still more\nhorribly. ”Ketchum plenty mo’ dolla, me no tell, mebbyso.”\nMiss Georgie felt blindly for her chair, and when she touched it\nshe backed and sank into it rather heavily. She looked white and\nsick, and Hagar eyed her gloatingly.\n”Yo’ no like for Good Injun be killum rope,” she chuckled. ”Yo’\nall time thinkum heap bueno. Mebbyso yo’ love. Yo’ buy? Yo’\n172\npayum much dolla?”\nMiss Georgie passed a hand slowly over her eyes. She felt numb,\nand she could not think, and she must think. A shuﬄing sound\nat the door made her drop her hand and look up, but there was\nnothing to lighten her oppressive sense of danger to Grant.\nAnother squaw had appeared, was all. A young squaw, with\nbright-red ribbons braided into her shining black hair, and\ngreat, sad eyes brightening the dull copper tint of her face.\n”You no be ’fraid,” she murmured shyly to Miss Georgie, and\nstopped where she was just inside the door. ”You no be sad. No\ntrouble come Good Injun. I friend.”\nHagar turned, and snarled at her in short, barking words which\nMiss Georgie could not understand. The young squaw folded her\narms inside her bright, plaid shawl, and listened with an\nindiﬀerence bordering closely on contempt, one would judge from\nher masklike face. Hagar turned from berating her, and thrust\nout her chin at Miss Georgie.\n”I go. Sun go ’way, mebbyso I come. Mebbyso yo’ heart bad. Me\nketchum much dolla yo’, me no tellum, mebbyso. No ketchum, me\ntell sheriﬀ mans Good Injun all time killum Man-that-coughs.”\nTurning, she waddled out, jabbing viciously at the young squaw\nwith her elbow as she passed, and spitting out some sort of\nthreat or command–Miss Georgie could not tell which.\nThe young squaw lingered, still gazing shyly at Miss Georgie.\n”You no be ’fraid,” she repeated softly. ”I friend. I take\ncare. No trouble come Good Injun. I no let come. You no be\nsad.” She smiled wistfully, and was gone, as silently as moved\nher shadow before her on the cinders.\nMiss Georgie stood by the window with her ﬁngernails making\nlittle red half-moons in her palms, and watched the three squaws\npad out of sight on the narrow trail to their camp, with the\nyoung squaw following after, until only a black head could be\nseen bobbing over the brow of the hill. When even that was gone,\nshe turned from the window, and stood for a long minute with her\nhands pressed tightly over her face. She was trying to think,\nbut instead she found herself listening intently to the\nmonotonous ”Ah-h-CHUCK! ah-h-CHUCK!” of the steam pump down the\ntrack, and to the spasmodic clicking of an order from the\ndispatcher to the passenger train two stations to the west.\nWhen the train was cleared and the wires idle, she went suddenly\nto the table, laid her ﬁngers purposefully upon the key, and\ncalled up her chief. It was another two hours’ leave of absence\n173\nshe asked for ”on urgent business.” She got it, seasoned with a\nsarcastic reminder that her business was supposed to be with the\nrailroad company, and that she would do well to cultivate\nexactness of expression and a taste for her duties in the oﬃce.\nShe was putting on her hat even while she listened to the\nmessage, and she astonished the man at the other end by making no\nretort whatever. She almost ran to the store, and she did not\nask Pete for a saddle-horse; she just threw her oﬃce key at\nhim, and told him she was going to take his bay, and she was at\nthe stable before he closed the mouth he had opened in amazement\nat her whirlwind departure.\nCHAPTER XXV\n”I’D JUST AS SOON HANG FOR NINE MEN AS FOR ONE”\nBaumberger climbed heavily out of the rig,and went lurching\ndrunkenly up the path to the house where the cool shade of the\ngrove was like paradise set close against the boundary of the\npurgatory of blazing sunshine and scorching sand. He had not\ngone ten steps from the stable when he met Good Indian face to\nface.\n”Hullo,” he growled, stopping short and eying him malevolently\nwith lowered head.\nGood Indian’s lips curled silently, and he stepped aside to\npursue his way. Baumberger swung his huge body toward him.\n”I said HULLO. Nothin’ wrong in that, is there? HULLO–d’yuh\nhear?”\n”Go to the devil!” said Grant shortly.\nBaumberger leered at him oﬀensively. ”Pretty Polly! Never\nlearned but one set uh words in his life. Can’t yuh say anything\nbut ’Go to the devil!’ when a man speaks to yuh? Hey?”\n”I could say a whole lot that you wouldn’t be particularly glad\nto hear.” Good Indian stopped, and faced him, coldly angry. For\none thing, he knew that Evadna was waiting on the porch for him,\nand could see even if she could not hear; and Baumberger’s\nattitude was insulting. ”I think,” he said meaningly, ”I\nwouldn’t press the point if I were you.”\n174\n”Giving me advice, hey? And who the devil are you?”\n”I wouldn’t ask, if I were you. But if you really want to know,\nI’m the fellow you hired Saunders to shoot. You blundered that\ntime. You should have picked a better man, Mr. Baumberger.\nSaunders couldn’t have hit the side of a barn if he’d been locked\ninside it. You ought to have made sure–”\nBaumberger glared at him, and then lunged, his eyes like an\nanimal gone mad.\n”I’ll make a better job, then!” he bellowed. ”Saunders was a\nfool. I told him to get down next the trail and make a good job\nof it. I told him to kill you, you lying, renegade Injun–and if\nhe couldn’t, I can! Yuh WILL watch me, hey?”\nGood Indian backed from him in sheer amazement. Epithets\nunprintable poured in a stream from the loose, evil lips.\nBaumberger was a raving beast of a man. He would have torn the\nother to pieces and reveled in the doing. He bellowed forth\nthreats against Good Indian and the Harts, young and old, and\nvaunted rashly the things he meant to do. Heat-mad and drink-mad\nhe was, and it was as if the dam of his wily amiability had\nbroken and let loose the whole vile reservoir of his pirate mind.\nHe tried to strike Good Indian down where he stood, and when his\nblows were parried he stopped, swayed a minute in drunken\nuncertainty, and then make one of his catlike motions, pulled a\ngun, and ﬁred without really taking aim.\nAnother gun spoke then, and Baumberger collapsed in the sand, a\nquivering heap of gross human ﬂesh. Good Indian stood and\nlooked down at him ﬁxedly while the smoke ﬂoated away from the\nmuzzle of his own gun. He heard Evadna screaming hysterically at\nthe gate, and looked over there inquiringly. Phoebe was running\ntoward him, and the boys–Wally and Gene and Jack, from the\nblacksmith shop. At the corner of the stable Miss Georgie was\nsliding from her saddle, her riding whip clenched tightly in her\nhand as she hurried to him. Peaceful stood beside the team, with\nthe lines still in his hand.\nIt was Miss Georgie’s words which reached him clearly.\n”You just HAD to do it, Grant. I saw the whole thing. You HAD\nto.”\n”Oh, Grant–GRANT! What have you done? What have you done?”\nThat was Phoebe Hart, saying the same thing over and over with a\nqueer, moaning inﬂection in her voice.\n”D’yuh KILL him?” Gene shouted excitedly, as he ran up to the\n175\nspot.\n”Yes.” Good Indian glanced once more at the heap before him.\n”And I’m liable to kill a few more before I’m through with the\ndeal.” He swung short around, discovered that Evadna was\nclutching his arm and crying, and pulled loose from her with a\ngesture of impatience. With the gun still in his hand, he walked\nquickly down the road in the direction of the garden.\n”He’s mad! The boy is mad! He’s going to kill–” Phoebe gave a\nsob, and ran after him, and with her went Miss Georgie and\nEvadna, white-faced, all three of them.\n”Come on, boys–he’s going to clean out the whole bunch!” whooped\nGene.\n”Oh, choke oﬀ!” Wally gritted disgustedly, glancing over his\nshoulder at them. ”Go back to the house, and STAY there! Ma,\nmake Vad quit that yelling, can’t yuh?” He looked eloquently at\nJack, keeping pace with him and smiling with the steely glitter\nin his eyes. ”Women make me sick!” he snorted under his breath.\nPeaceful stared after them, went into the stable, and got a\nblanket to throw over Baumberger’s inert body, stooped, and made\nsure that the man was dead, with the left breast of his light\nnegligee shirt all blackened with powder and soaked with blood;\ncovered him well, and tied up the team. Then he went to the\nhouse, and got the old riﬂe that had killed Indians and buﬀalo\nalike, and went quickly through the grove to the garden. He was\na methodical man, and he was counted slow, but nevertheless he\nreached the scene not much behind the others. Wally was trying\nto send his mother to the house with Evadna, and neither would\ngo. Miss Georgie was standing near Good Indian, watching Stanley\nwith her lips pressed together.\nIt is doubtful if Good Indian realized what the others were\ndoing. He had gone straight past the line of stakes to where\nStanley was sitting with his back against the lightning-stricken\napricot tree. Stanley was smoking a cigarette as if he had heard\nnothing of the excitement, but his riﬂe was resting upon his\nknee in such a manner that he had but to lift it and take aim.\nThe three others were upon their own claims, and they, also,\nseemed unobtrusively ready for whatever might be going to happen.\nGood Indian appraised the situation with a quick glance as he\ncame up, but he did not slacken his pace until he was within ten\nfeet of Stanley.\n”You’re across the dead line, m’ son,” said Stanley, with lazy\nsigniﬁcance. ”And you, too,” he added, ﬂickering a glance at\n176\nMiss Georgie.\n”The dead line,” said Good Indian coolly, ”is beyond the Point o’\nRocks. I’d like to see you on the other side by sundown.”\nStanley looked him over, from the crown of his gray hat to the\ntips of his riding-boots, and laughed when his eyes came back to\nGood Indian’s face. But the laugh died out rather suddenly at\nwhat he saw there.\n”Got the papers for that?” he asked calmly. But his jaw had\nsquared.\n”I’ve got something better than papers. Your boss is dead. I\nshot him just now. He’s lying back there by the stable.” Good\nIndian tilted his head backward, without taking his eyes from\nStanley’s face–and Stanley’s right hand, too, perhaps. ”If you\ndon’t want the same medicine, I’d advise you to quit.”\nStanley’s jaw dropped, but it was surprise which slackened the\nmuscles.\n”You–shot–”\n”Baumberger. I said it.”\n”You’ll hang for that,” Stanley stated impersonally, without\nmoving.\nGood Indian smiled, but it only made his face more ominous.\n”Well, they can’t hang a man more than once. I’ll see this ranch\ncleaned up while I’m about it. I’d just as soon,” he added\ncomposedly, ”be hanged for nine men as for one.”\nStanley sat on his haunches, and regarded him unwinkingly for so\nlong that Phoebe’s nerves took a panic, and she drew Evadna away\nfrom the place. The boys edged closer, their hands resting\nsuggestively upon their gun-butts. Old Peaceful half-raised his\nriﬂe, and held it so. It was like being compelled to watch a\nfuse hiss and shrivel and go black toward a keg of gun-powder.\n”I believe, by heck, you would!” said Stanley at last, and so\nlong a time had elapsed that even Good Indian had to think back\nto know what he meant. Stanley squinted up at the sun, hitched\nhimself up so that his back rested against the tree more\ncomfortably, inspected his cigarette, and then fumbled for a\nmatch with which to relight it. ”How’d you ﬁnd out Baumberger\nwas back uh this deal?” he asked curiously and without any\npersonal resentment in tone or manner, and raked the match along\n177\nhis thigh.\nGood Indian’s shoulders went up a little.\n”I knew, and that’s suﬃcient. The dead line is down past the\nPoint o’ Rocks. After sundown this ranch is going to hold the\nHarts and their friends–and NO ONE ELSE. Tell that to your\npals, unless you’ve got a grudge against them!”\nStanley held his cigarette between his ﬁngers, and blew smoke\nthrough his nostrils while he watched Good Indian turn his back\nand walk away. He did not easily lose his hold of himself, and\nthis was, with him, a cold business proposition.\nMiss Georgie stood where she was until she saw that Stanley did\nnot intend to shoot Good Indian in the back, as he might have\ndone easily enough, and followed so quickly that she soon came up\nwith him. Good Indian turned at the rustling of the skirts\nimmediately behind him, and looked down at her somberly. Then he\ncaught sight of something she was carrying in her hand, and he\ngave a short laugh.\n”What are you doing with that thing?” he asked peremptorily.\nMiss Georgie blushed very red, and slid the thing into her\npocket.\n”Well, every little helps,” she retorted, with a miserable\nattempt at her old breeziness of manner. ”I thought for a minute\nI’d have to shoot that man Stanley–when you turned your back on\nhim.”\nGood Indian stopped, looked at her queerly, and went on again\nwithout saying a word.\nCHAPTER XXVI\n”WHEN THE SUN GOES AWAY”\n”I wish,” said Phoebe, putting her two hands on Miss Georgie’s\nshoulders at the gate and looking up at her with haggard eyes,\n”you’d see what you can do with Vadnie. The poor child’s near\ncrazy; she ain’t used to seeing such things happen–”\n”Where is she?” Good Indian asked tersely, and was answered\nimmediately by the sound of sobbing on the east porch. The three\n178\nwent together, but it was Grant who reached her ﬁrst.\n”Don’t cry, Goldilocks,” he said tenderly, bending over her.\n”It’s all right now. There isn’t going to be any more–”\n”Oh! Don’t TOUCH me!” She sprang up and backed from him, horror\nplain in her wide eyes. ”Make him keep away, Aunt Phoebe!”\nGood Indian straightened, and stood perfectly still, looking at\nher in a stunned, incredulous way.\n”Chicken, don’t be silly!” Miss Georgie’s sane tones were like a\nbreath of clean air. ”You’ve simply gone all to pieces. I know\nwhat nerves can do to a woman–I’ve had ’em myself. Grant isn’t\ngoing to bite you, and you’re not afraid of him. You’re proud of\nhim, and you know it. He’s acted the man, chicken!–the man we\nknew he was, all along. So pull yourself together, and let’s not\nhave any nonsense.”\n”He–KILLED a man! I saw him do it. And he’s going to kill some\nmore. I might have known he was like that! I might have KNOWN\nwhen he tried to shoot me that night in the orchard when I was\ntrying to scare Gene! I can show you the mark–where he grazed my\narm! And he LAUGHED about it! I called him a savage then–and I\nwas RIGHT–only he can be so nice when he wants to be–and I\nforgot about the Indian in him–and then he killed Mr.\nBaumberger! He’s lying out there now! I’d rather DIE than let\nhim–”\nMiss Georgie clapped a hand over her mouth, and stopped her.\nAlso, she gripped her by the shoulder indignantly.\n”’Vadna Ramsey, I’m ashamed of you!” she cried furiously. ”For\nHeaven’s sake, Grant, go on oﬀ somewhere and wait till she\nsettles down. Don’t stand there looking like a stone\nimage–didn’t you ever see a case of nerves before? She doesn’t\nknow what she’s saying–if she did, she wouldn’t be saying it.\nYou go on, and let me handle her alone. Men are just a nuisance\nin a case like this.”\nShe pushed Evadna before her into the kitchen, waited until\nPhoebe had followed, and then closed the door gently and\ndecisively upon Grant. But not before she had given him a\nheartening smile just to prove that he must not take Evadna\nseriously, because she did not.\n”We’d better take her to her room, Mrs. Hart,” she suggested,\n”and make her lie down for a while. That poor fellow–as if he\ndidn’t have enough on his hands without this!”\n179\n”I’m not on his hands! And I won’t lie down!” Evadna jerked away\nfrom Miss Georgie, and confronted them both pantingly, her cheeks\nstill wet with tears. ”You act as if I don’t know what I’m\ndoing’ and I DO know. If I should lie down for a MILLION YEARS,\nI’d feel just the same about it. I couldn’t bear him to TOUCH\nme! I–”\n”For Heaven’s sake, don’t shout it,” Miss Georgie interrupted,\nexasperatedly. ”Do you want him–”\n”To hear? Idon’t care whether he does or not.” Evadna was\nturning sullen at the opposition. ”He’ll have to know it SOME\nTIME, won’t he? If you think can forgive a thing like that and\nlet–”\n”He had to do it. Baumberger would have killed HIM. He had a\nperfect right to kill. He’d have been a fool and a coward if he\nhadn’t. You come and lie down a while.”\n”I WON’T lie down. I don’t care if he did have to do it–I\ncouldn’t love him afterward. And he didn’t have to go down there\nand threaten Stanley–and–HE’LL DO IT, TOO!” She fell to\ntrembling again. ”He’ll DO it–at sundown.”\nPhoebe and Miss Georgie looked at each other. He would, if the\nmen stayed. They knew that.\n”And I was going to marry him!” Evadna shuddered when she said\nit, and covered her face with her two hands. ”He wasn’t sorry\nafterward; you could see he wasn’t sorry. He was ready to kill\nmore men. It’s the Indian in him. He LIKES to kill people.\nHe’ll kill those men, and he won’t be a bit sorry he did it. And\nhe could come to me afterward and expect me–Oh, what does he\nthink I AM?” She leaned against the wall, and sobbed.\n”I suppose,” she wailed, lashing herself with every bitter\nthought she could conjure, ”he killed Saunders, too, like old\nHagar said. He wouldn’t tell me where he was that morning. I\nasked him, and he wouldn’t tell. He was up there killing\nSaunders–”\n”If you don’t shut up, I’ll shake you!” Miss Georgie in her fury\ndid not wait, but shook her anyway as if she had been a\nten-year-old child in a tantrum.\n”My Heavens above! I’ll stand for nerves and hysterics, and\nalmost any old thing, but you’re going a little bit too far, my\nlady. There’s no excuse for your talking such stuﬀ as that, and\nyou’re not going to do it, if I have to gag you! Now, you march\nto your own room and–STAY there. Do you hear? And don’t you\n180\ndare let another yip out of you till you can talk sense.”\nGood Indian stood upon the porch, and heard every word of that.\nHe heard also the shuﬄe of feet as Miss Georgie urged Evadna to\nher room–it sounded almost as if she dragged her there by\nforce–and he rolled a cigarette with ﬁngers that did not so\nmuch as quiver. He scratched a match upon the nearest post, and\nafterward leaned there and smoked, and stared out over the pond\nand up at the bluﬀ glowing yellow in the sunlight. His face was\nset and expressionless except that it was stoically calm, and\nthere was a glitter deep down in his eyes. Evadna was right, to\na certain extent the Indian in him held him quiet.\nIt occurred to him that someone ought to pick up Baumberger, and\nput him somewhere, but he did not move. The boys and Peaceful\nmust have stayed down in the garden, he thought. He glanced up\nat the tops of the nodding poplars, and estimated idly by their\nshadow on the bluﬀ how long it would be before sundown, and as\nidly wondered if Stanley and the others would go, or stay.\nThere was nothing they could gain by staying, he knew, now that\nBaumberger was out of it. Unless they got stubborn and wanted to\nﬁght. In that case, he supposed he would eventually be planted\nalongside his father. He wished he could keep the boys and old\nPeaceful out of it, in case there was a ﬁght, but he knew that\nwould be impossible. The boys, at least, had been itching for\nsomething like this ever since the trouble started.\nGood Indian had, not so long ago, spent hours in avoiding all\nthought that he might prolong the ecstasy of mere feeling. Now\nhe had reversed the desire. He was thinking of this thing and of\nthat, simply that he might avoid feeling. If someone didn’t kill\nhim within the next hour or so, he was going to feel\nsomething–something that would hurt him more than he had been\nhurt since his father died in that same house. But in the\nmeantime he need only think.\nThe shadow of the grove, with the long ﬁngers of tho poplars to\npoint the way, climbed slowly up the bluﬀ. Good Indian smoked\nanother cigarette while he watched it. When a certain great\nbowlder that was like a miniature ledge glowed rosily and then\nslowly darkened to a chill gray, he threw his cigarette stub\nunerringly at a lily-pad which had courtesied many a time before\nto a like missile from his hand, pulled his hat down over his\neyes, jumped oﬀ the porch, and started around the house to the\ngate which led to the stable.\nPhoebe came out from the sitting-room, ran down the steps, and\nbarred his way.\n”Grant!” she said, and there were tears in her eyes, ”don’t do\n181\nanything rash–don’t. If it’s for our sakes–and I know it\nis–don’t do it. They’ll go, anyway. We’ll have the law on them\nand make them go. But don’t YOU go down there. You let Thomas\nhandle that part. You’re like one of my own boys. I can’t let\nyou go!”\nHe looked down at her commiseratingly. ”I’ve got to go, Mother\nHart. I’ve made my war-talk.” He hesitated, bent his head, and\nkissed her on the forehead as she stood looking up at him, and\nwent on.\n”Grant–GRANT!” she cried heartbrokenly after him, and sank down\non the porch-steps with her face hidden in her arms.\nMiss Georgie was standing beside the gate, looking toward the\nstable. She may not have been waiting for him, but she turned\nwithout any show of surprise when he walked up behind her.\n”Well, your jumpers seem to have taken the hint,” she informed\nhim, with a sort of surface cheerfulness. ”Stanley is down there\ntalking to Mr. Hart now, and the others have gone on. They’ll\nall be well over the dead-line by sundown. There goes Stanley\nnow. Do you really feel that your future happiness depends on\ngetting through this gate? Well–if you must–” She swung it\nopen, but she stood in the opening.\n”Grant, I–it’s hard to say just what I want to say–but–you did\nright. You acted the man’s part. No matter what–others–may\nthink or say, remember that I think you did right to kill that\nman. And if there’s anything under heaven that I can do, to–to\nhelp–you’ll let me do it, won’t you?” Her eyes held him brieﬂy,\nunabashed at what they might tell. Then she stepped back, and\ncontradicted them with a little laugh. ”I will get ﬁred sure\nfor staying over my time,” she said. ”I’ll wire for the coroner\nsoon as I get to the oﬃce. This will never come to a trial,\nGrant. He was like a crazy man, and we all saw him shoot ﬁrst.”\nShe waited until he had passed through and was a third of the way\nto the stable where Peaceful Hart and his boys were gathered, and\nthen she followed him briskly, as if her mind was taken up with\nher own aﬀairs.\n”It’s a shame yon fellows got cheated out of a scrap,” she\ntaunted Jack, who held her horse for her while she settled\nherself in the saddle. ”You were all spoiling for a ﬁght–and\nthere did seem to be the makings of a beautiful row!”\nSave for the fact that she kept her eyes studiously turned away\nfrom a certain place near by, where the dust was pressed down\nsmoothly with the weight of a heavy body, and all around was\n182\ntrampled and tracked, one could not have told that Miss Georgie\nremembered anything tragic.\nBut Good Indian seemed to recall something, and went quickly over\nto her just in time to prevent her starting.\n”Was there something in particular you wanted when you came?” he\nasked, laying a hand on the neck of the bay. ”It just occurred\nto me that there must have been.”\nShe leaned so that the others could not hear, and her face was\ngrave enough now.\n”Why, yes. It’s old Hagar. She came to me this afternoon, and\nshe had that bunch of hair you cut oﬀ that was snarled in the\nbush. She had your knife. She wanted me to buy them–the old\nblackmailer! She made threats, Grant–about Saunders. She says\nyou–I came right down to tell you, because I was afraid she\nmight make trouble. But there was so much more on hand right\nhere”–she glanced involuntarily at the trampled place in the\ndust. ”She said she’d come back this evening, ’when the sun\ngoes away.’ She’s there now, most likely. What shall I tell her?\nWe can’t have that story mouthed all over the country.”\nGood Indian twisted a wisp of mane in his ﬁngers, and frowned\nabstractedly.\n”If you’ll ride on slowly,” he told her, at last straightening\nthe twisted lock, ”I’ll overtake you. I think I’d better see\nthat old Jezebel myself.”\nSecretly he was rather thankful for further action. He told the\nboys when they ﬁred questions at his hurried saddling that he\nwas going to take Miss Georgie home, and that he would be back\nbefore long; in an hour, probably. Then he galloped down the\ntrail, and overtook her at the Point o’ Rocks.\nThe sun was down, and the sky was a great, glowing mass of color.\nRound the second turn of the grade they came upon Stanley,\nwalking with his hands thrust in his trousers pockets and\nwhistling softly to himself as if he were thinking deeply.\nPerhaps he was glad to be let oﬀ so easily.\n”Abandoning my claim,” he announced, lightly as a man of his\nprosaic temperament could speak upon such a subject. ”Dern poor\nplacer mining down there, if yuh want to know!”\nGood Indian scowled at him and rode on, because a woman rode\nbeside him. Seven others they passed farther up the hill. Those\nseven gave him scowl for scowl, and did not speak a word; that\n183\nalso because a woman rode beside him. And the woman understood,\nand was glad that she was there.\nFrom the Indian camp, back in the sage-inclosed hollow, rose a\nsound of high-keyed wailing. The two heard it, and looked at\neach other questioningly.\n”Something’s up over there,” Good Indian said, answering her\nlook. ”That sounds to me like the squaws howling over a death.”\n”Let’s go and see. I’m so late now, a few minutes more won’t\nmatter, one way or the other.” Miss Georgie pulled out her\nwatch, looked at it, and made a little grimace. So they turned\ninto the winding trail, and rode into the camp.\nThere were confusion, and wailing, and a buzzing of squaws around\na certain wikiup. Dogs sat upon their haunches, and howled\nlugubriously until someone in passing kicked them into yelping\ninstead. Papooses stood nakedly about, and regarded the uproar\nsolemnly, running to peer into the wikiup and then scamper back\nto their less hardy fellows. Only the bucks stood apart in\nhaughty unconcern, speaking in undertones when they talked at\nall. Good Indian commanded Miss Georgie to remain just outside\nthe camp, and himself rode in to where the bucks were gathered.\nThen he saw Peppajee sitting beside his own wikiup, and went to\nhim instead.\n”What’s the matter here, Peppajee?” he asked. ”Heap trouble walk\ndown at Hart Ranch. Trouble walk here all same, mebbyso?”\nPeppajee looked at him sourly, but the news was big, and it must\nbe told.\n”Heap much trouble come. Squaw callum Hagar make much talk. Do\nmuch bad, mebbyso. Squaw Rachel ketchum bad heart along yo’.\nHeap cry all time. No sleepum, no eatum–all time heap sad.\nKetchum bad spirit, mebbyso. Ketchum debbil. Sun go ’way,\nketchum knife, go Hagar wikiup. Killum Hagar–so.” He thrust\nout his arm as one who stabs. ”Killum himself–so.” He struck\nhis chest with his clenched ﬁst. ”Hagar heap dead. Rachel heap\ndead. Kay bueno. Mebbyso yo’ heap bad medicine. Yo’ go.”\n”A squaw just died,” he told Miss Georgie curtly, when they rode\non. But her quick eyes noted a new look in his face. Before it\nhad been grave and stern and bitter; now it was sorrowful\ninstead.\n184\nCHAPTER XXVII\nLIFE ADJUSTS ITSELF AGAIN TO SOME THINGS\nThe next day was a day of dust hanging always over the grade\nbecause of much hurried riding up and down; a day of many strange\nfaces whose eyes peered curiously at the place where Baumberger\nfell, and at the cold ashes of Stanley’s campﬁre, and at the\nHarts and their house, and their horses and all things pertaining\nin the remotest degree to the drama which had been played grimly\nthere to its last, tragic ”curtain.” They stared up at the\nrim-rock and made various estimates of the distance and argued\nover the question of marksmanship, and whether it really took a\ngood shot to ﬁre from the top and hit a man below.\nAs for the killing of Baumberger, public opinion tried–with the\naid of various plugs of tobacco and much expectoration–the case\nand rendered a unanimous verdict upon it long before the coroner\narrived. ”Done just right,” was the verdict of Public Opinion,\nand the self-constituted judges manifested their further approval\nby slapping Good Indian upon the back when they had a chance, or\nby solemnly shaking hands with him, or by facetiously assuring\nhim that they would be good. All of which Grant interpreted\ncorrectly as sympathy and a desire to show him that they did not\nlook upon him as a murderer, but as a man who had the courage to\ndefend himself and those dear to him from a great danger.\nWith everything so agreeably disposed of according to the\ncrude–though none the less true, perhaps–ethics of the time and\nthe locality, it was tacitly understood that the coroner and the\ninquest he held in the grove beside the house were a mere\nconcession to red tape. Nevertheless a general tension\nmanifested itself when the jury, after solemnly listening, in\ntheir oﬃcial capacity, to the evidence they had heard and\ndiscussed freely hours before, bent heads and whispered brieﬂy\ntogether. There was also a corresponding atmosphere of relief\nwhen the verdict of Public Opinion was called justiﬁable\nhomicide by the coroner and so stamped with oﬃcial approval.\nWhen that was done they carried Baumberger’s gross physical shell\naway up the grade to the station; and the dust of his passing\nsettled upon the straggling crowd that censured his misdeeds and\nmourned not at all, and yet paid tribute to his dead body with\nlowered voices while they spoke of him, and with awed silence\nwhen the rough box was lowered to the station platform.\nAs the sky clears and grows blue and deep and unfathomably\npeaceful after a storm, as trees wind-riven straighten and nod\n185\ngraciously to the little cloud-boats that sail the blue above,\nand wave dainty ﬁnger-tips of branches in bon voyage, so did the\nPeaceful Hart ranch, when the dust had settled after the latest\ndeparture and the whistle of the train–which bore the coroner\nand that other quiet passenger–came faintly down over the\nrim-rock, settle with a sigh of relief into its old, easy habits\nof life.\nAll, that is, save Good Indian himself, and perhaps one other.\n. . . . . . . . .\nPeaceful cleared his white mustache and beard from a few stray\ndrops of coﬀee and let his mild blue eyes travel slowly around\nthe table, from one tanned young face to another.\n”Now the excitement’s all over and done with,” he drawled in his\nhalf-apologetic tones, ”it wouldn’t be a bad idea for you boys to\nget to work and throw the water back where it belongs. I dunno\nbut what the garden’s spoiled already; but the small fruit can be\nsaved.”\n”Clark and I was going up to the Injun camp,” spoke up Gene. ”We\nwanted to see–”\n”You’ll have to do some riding to get there,” Good Indian\ninformed them dryly. ”They hit the trail before sunrise this\nmorning.”\n”Huh! What were YOU doing up there that time of day?” blurted\nWally, eying him sharply.\n”Watching the sun rise.” His lips smiled over the retort, but\nhis eyes did not. ”I’ll lower the water in your milk-house now,\nMother Hart,” he promised lightly, ”so you won’t have to wear\nrubber-boots when you go to skim the milk.” He gave Evadna a\nquick, sidelong glance as she came into the room, and pushed back\nhis chair. ”I’ll get at it right away,” he said cheerfully,\npicked up his hat, and went out whistling. Then he put his head\nin at the door. ”Say,” he called, ”does anybody know where that\nlong-handled shovel is?” Again he eyed Evadna without seeming to\nsee her at all.\n”If it isn’t down at the stable,” said Jack soberly, ”or by the\napple-cellar or somewhere around the pond or garden, look along\nthe ditches as far up as the big meadow. And if you don’t run\nacross it there–” The door slammed, and Jack laughed with his\neyes fast shut and three dimples showing.\nEvadna sank listlessly into her chair and regarded him and all\n186\nher little world with frank disapproval.\n”Upon my WORD, I don’t see how anybody can laugh, after what has\nhappened on this place,” she said dismally, ”or–WHISTLE,\nafter–” Her lips quivered a little. She was a distressed\nChristmas angel, if ever there was one.\nWally snorted. ”Want us to go CRYING around because the row’s\nover?” he demanded. ”Think Grant ought to wear crepe, I\nsuppose–because he ain’t on ice this morning–or in jail, which\nhe’d hate a lot worse. Think we ought to go around with our jaws\nhanging down so you could step on ’em, because Baumberger cashed\nin? Huh! All hurts MY feelings is, I didn’t get a whack at the\nold devil myself!” It was a long speech for Wally to make, and he\nmade it with deliberate malice.\n”Now you’re shouting!” applauded Gene, also with the intent to be\nshocking.\n”THAT’S the stuﬀ,” approved Clark, grinning at Evadna’s\nhorriﬁed eyes.\n”Grant can run over me sharp-shod and I won’t say a word, for\nwhat he did day before yesterday,” declared Jack, opening his\neyes and looking straight at Evadna. ”You don’t see any tears\nrolling down MY cheeks, I hope?”\n”Good Injun’s the stuﬀ, all right. He’d ’a’ licked the hull\ndamn–”\n”Now, Donny, be careful what language you use,” Phoebe\nadmonished, and so cut short his high-pitched song of praise.\n”I don’t care–I think it’s perfectly awful.” Evadna looked\ndistastefully upon her breakfast. ”I just can’t sleep in that\nroom, Aunt Phoebe. I tried not to think about it, but it opens\nright that way.”\n”Huh!” snorted Wally. ”Board up the window, then, so you can’t\nsee the fatal spot!” His gray eyes twinkled. ”I could DANCE on\nit myself,” he said, just to horrify her–which he did. Evadna\nshivered, pressed her wisp of handkerchief against her lips, and\nleft the table hurriedly.\n”You boys ought to be ashamed of yourselves!” Phoebe scolded\nhalf-heartedly; for she had lived long in the wild, and had seen\nmuch that was raw and primitive. ”You must take into\nconsideration that Vadnie isn’t used to such things. Why, great\ngrief! I don’t suppose the child ever SAW a dead man before in\nher life–unless he was laid out in church with ﬂower-anchors\n187\npiled knee-deep all over him. And to see one shot right before\nher very eyes–and by the man she expects–or did expect to\nmarry–why, you can’t wonder at her looking at it the way she\ndoes. It isn’t Vadnie’s fault. It’s the way she’s been raised.”\n”Well,” observed Wally in the manner of delivering an ultimatum,\n”excuse ME from any Eastern raising!”\nA little later, Phoebe boldly invaded the secret chambers of Good\nIndian’s heart when he was readjusting the rocks which formed the\nﬂoor of the milk-house.\n”Now, Grant,” she began, laying her hand upon his shoulder as he\nknelt before her, straining at a heavy rock, ”Mother Hart is\ngoing to give you a little piece of her mind about something\nthat’s none of her business maybe.”\n”You can give me as many pieces as you like. They’re always good\nmedicine,” he assured her. But he kept his head bent so that his\nhat quite hid his face from her. ”What about?” he asked, a\nbetraying tenseness in his voice.\n”About Vadnie–and you. I notice you don’t speak–you haven’t\nthat I’ve seen, since that day–on the porch. You don’t want to\nbe too hard on her, Grant. Remember she isn’t used to such\nthings. She looks at it diﬀerent. She’s never seen the times,\nas I have, where it’s kill or be killed. Be patient with her,\nGrant–and don’t feel hard. She’ll get over it. I want,” she\nstopped because her voice was beginning to shake ”–I want my\nbiggest boy to be happy.” Her hand slipped around his neck and\npressed his head against her knee.\nGood Indian got up and put his arms around her and held her\nclose. He did not say anything at all for a minute, but when he\ndid he spoke very quietly, stroking her hair the while.\n”Mother Hart, I stood on the porch and heard what she said in the\nkitchen. She accused me of killing Saunders. She said I liked\nto kill people; that I shot at her and laughed at the mark I made\non her arm. She called me a savage–an Indian. My mother’s\nmother was the daughter of a chief. She was a good woman; my\nmother was a good woman; just as good as if she had been white.\n”Mother Hart, I’m a white man in everything but half my mother’s\nblood. I don’t remember her–but I respect her memory, and I am\nnot ashamed because she was my mother. Do you think I could\nmarry a girl who thinks of my mother as something which she must\ntry to forgive? Do you think I could go to that girl in there\nand–and take her in my arms–and love her, knowing that she\nfeels as she does? She can’t even forgive me for killing that\n188\nbeast!\n”She’s a beautiful thing–I wanted to have her for my own. I’m a\nman. I’ve a healthy man’s hunger for a beautiful woman, but I’ve\na healthy man’s pride as well.” He patted the smooth cheek of\nthe only woman he had ever known as a mother, and stared at the\nrough rock wall oozing moisture that drip-dripped to the pool\nbelow.\n”I did think I’d go away for awhile,” he said after a minute\nspent in sober thinking. ”But I never dodged yet, and I never\nran. I’m going to stay and see the thing through, now. I don’t\nknow–” he hesitated and then went on. ”It may not last; I may\nhave to suﬀer after awhile, but standing out there, that day,\nlistening to her carrying on, kind of–oh, I can’t explain it.\nBut I don’t believe I wes half as deep in love as I thought I\nwas. I don’t want to say anything against her; I’ve no right,\nfor she’s a thousand times better than I am. But she’s\ndiﬀerent. She never would understand our ways, Mother Hart, or\nlook at life as we do; some people go through life looking at the\nlittle things that don’t matter, and passing by the other, bigger\nthings. If you keep your eye glued to a microscope long enough,\nyou’re sure to lose the sense of proportion.\n”She won’t speak to me,” he continued after a short silence. ”I\ntried to talk to her yesterday–”\n”But you must remember, the poor child was hysterical that day\nwhen–she went on so. She doesn’t know anything about the\nrealities of life. She doesn’t mean to be hard.”\n”Yesterday,” said Grant with an odd little smile, ”she was not\nhysterical. It seems that–shooting–was the last little weight\nthat tilted the scale against me. I don’t think she ever cared\ntwo whoops for me, to tell you the truth. She’s been ashamed of\nmy Indian blood all along; she said so. And I’m not a good\nlover; I neglected her all the while this trouble lasted, and I\npaid more attention to Georgie Howard than I did to her–and I\ndidn’t satisfactorily explain about that hair and knife that\nHagar had. And–oh, it isn’t the killing, altogether! I guess we\nwere both a good deal mistaken in our feelings.”\n”Well, I hope so,” sighed Phoebe, wondering secretly at the\ndecadence of love. An emotion that could burn high and hot in a\nweek, ﬂare bravely for a like space, and die out with no seared\nheart to pay for the extravagance–she shook her head at it.\nThat was not what she had been taught to call love, and she\nwondered how a man and a maid could be mistaken about so vital an\nemotion.\n189\n”I suppose,” she added with unusual sarcasm for her, ”you’ll be\nfalling in love with Georgie Howard, next thing anybody knows;\nand maybe that will last a week or ten days before you ﬁnd out\nyou were MISTAKEN!”\nGood Indian gave her one of his quick, sidelong glances.\n”She would not be eternally apologizing to herself for liking me,\nanyway,” he retorted acrimoniously, as if he found it very hard\nto forgive Evadna her conscious superiority of race and\nupbringing. ”Squaw.”\n”Oh, I haven’t a doubt of that!” Phoebe rose to the defense of\nher own blood. ”I don’t know as it’s in her to apologize for\nanything. I never saw such a girl for going right ahead as if\nher way is the only way! Bull-headed, I’d call her.” She looked\nat Good Indian afterward, studying his face with motherly\nsolicitude.\n”I believe you’re half in love with her right now and don’t know\nit!” she accused suddenly.\nGood Indian laughed softly and bent to his work again.\n”ARE you, Grant?” Phoebe laid a moist hand on his shoulder, and\nfelt the muscles sliding smoothly beneath his clothing while he\nmoved a rock. ”I ain’t mad because you and Vadnie fell out; I\nkind of looked for it to happen. Love that grows like a mushroom\nlasts about as long–only Idon’t call it love! You might tell\nme–”\n”Tell you what?” But Grant did not look up. ”If I don’t know it,\nI can’t tell it.” He paused in his lifting and rested his hands\nupon his knees, the ﬁngers dripping water back into the spring.\nHe felt that Phoebe was waiting, and he pressed his lips\ntogether. ”Must a man be in love with some woman all the time?”\nHe shook his ﬁngers impatiently so that the last drops hurried\nto the pool.\n”She’s a good girl, and a brave girl,” Phoebe remarked\nirrelevantly.\nGood Indian felt that she was still waiting, with all the quiet\npersistence of her sex when on the trail of a romance. He\nreached up and caught the hand upon his shoulder, and laid it\nagainst his cheek. He laughed surrender.\n”Squaw-talk-far-oﬀ heap smart,” he mimicked old Peppajee\ngravely. ”Heap bueno.” He stood up as suddenly as he had\nstarted his rock-lifting a few minutes before, and taking Phoebe\n190\nby the shoulders, shook her with gentle insistence. ”Put don’t\nmake me fall out of one love right into another,” he protested\nwhimsically. ”Give a fellow time to roll a cigarette, can’t\nyou?”\n191",
