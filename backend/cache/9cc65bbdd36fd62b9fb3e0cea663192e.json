But\nwhat I’mtrying togetyoutounderstand iswhat I’mdealing\nwith here onmyend—“ pleaded Alan Shiner intoatinymobile\nphone, with theother hand covering hisear. Hiswhole body\nmotioned when heemphasized apoint onthephone, because\nhe couldn’t use his hands as in a personal conversation.\n“Donnie, Donnie, youdon’t even have toexplain tomeany-\nmore. Youthink Idon’t know? Ofcourse Iknow. I’veworked\nwith thisguyfor40years. Iknow likeyouhave noidea Iknow.\nYou see where I’m going with this?”\nAndthat ended hisplea with thebig-time director ofthenew\nfilm that Alan’s oldest client, Howard Kessler, was being\nkicked offand replaced with ayounger lead actor. Atleast\nyounger wastheexcuse they used. And inHollywood, that’s a\nviable excuse.\nThedeal wastentative, atbest, when itwassigned, andAlan\nknew it.Itcame ontheheels ofyetanother scandal that\nHoward brought onhimself. While onsetfilming apublic ser-\nvice announcement forachildren’s charitable organization, he\nwas caught doing lines and getting ablowjob byone ofthe\nP.A.’s inatrailer. And theP.A. was apparently only 17years\nold.Itwaslikethese media-friendly train-wrecks were happen-\ning one a month.\nSoanydeal forHoward was agood deal, these days. At66,\nHoward’s lead actor status was diminished, buthisego and\ndenial were hisdriving forces, sobreaking thisnews wasn’t go-\ningtobeahigh point ofAlan’s day. He’d been anagent for\nnearly 50years, andlikeHoward, wasfrom Brooklyn andmade\nitouttoHollywood andsetdown roots. Hedidn’t want tosee\noneofhispeers getoldbecause thatmeant thathe,too,should\n2\nhang itupsoon. Sohewasreally pulling forHoward, hismost\nlucrative client, the actor that made Alan a star agent.\nAlan shifted hisweight onhisfeet and paced. Hewas just\noutside thelunch spot hecame toevery daywhen hewasn’t\nentertaining clients—a small Vietnamese bistro where they\ntreated himliketheking hefelthewas. Hestepped outside to\ntake thecallfrom thedirector. Alan rarely takes calls inres-\ntaurants—and even inL.A. where doing deals onthephone\nover ameal isjustaregular extension oftheoffice. Alan sees\nhisbusiness asoneofdiscretion; he’s anold-school shark. Be-\nfore stepping back intohistable, hepaced some more outside\nand flipped open hisphone again todial Howard, hoping he\nwouldn’t answer.\n“Howie, it’sAlan. You, uh,you, thepicture, justcallme,” he\nsaid in a whisper.\nAlan whispered when there wasbadnews. Hedidn’t even do\nitpurposely. Hisdemeanor wassuch adead giveaway when he\nhadbadnews totell,that hefrequently didn’t even have toex-\nplain thedetails, people knew immediately. Last week he\ncalled hiswife from thedelitotellherthey were outofwhite-\nfishsalad. Inthehushed tones, likeasifhewastelling herthat\nthe dog had cancer.\nToday hewas broken up.Hestepped inside, putsome cash\ndown onthetable and walked back tohiscar, thinking that\nthismay justbethebeginning oftheendforboth Howard and\nhimself.\nHoward’s sprawling Malibu home was usually packed with\npeople onaFriday afternoon. He,orhisgirlfriend atthetime,\nwould entertain bythepool, play high-stakes card games, and\nshow movies inhis50-seat custom built home movie theater.\nHe’s amovie star; they candothings likethat. Today, though,\nthecavernous, sun-filled house was empty. Howard sensed\nthat Alan’s callwould becoming. Itwasn’t thefirst time he’d\ngotten badnews recently from hisagent andhisfriend, butthe\nfirst time thatadeal hadbeen actually signed andthen broken.\nHoward knew that when thishappened inHollywood, itwasa\ntactic used topinhimasthebargaining chip forstudios toget\nanother actor with a higher price tag. It happens all the time.\nThis came right after adisastrous episode ontheStern radio\nshow, when theinterview didn’t goasplanned andthewack\n3\npack ganged uponHowie about hisrecent, high-profile plea\ndeal hecutwith prosecutors onanindictment forhisrole ina\nhigh-net worth betting ring. Instead ofjoking hisway outofit,\nhecursed andspitinhisdefense. Thefollowing week, media\nloudmouth JonHein’s commentary revealed histhoughts about\nHoward Kessler’s Hollywood status: jumped theshark. Howard\nknew that once youjump theshark, youweren’t jumping back\ninthebigpictures that thestudios, once upon atime, would\nline up for his involvement.\nThe phone rang.\n“Alan Iknow what you’re gonna say,” hetook adeep breath\ninasifhewasgoing togive along response. “This isshit. It’s\njust shit,” Howard exhaled.\n“Howie, Iknow, thisasshole director, what ishe,French or\nsomething? Anyway, he’s ashitandthestudio’s shit—I don’t\nknow what else tosay. Youknow I’mworking foryou, buddy,\nright?”\n“Listen, canwetake abreak—what amItrying todohere? I\njusthave towait itout.This town could useabreak from me.\nFive pictures in3years, it’slikeI’mTravolta. It’sfine, I’lltake\nsome time and we’ll see what comes up in the spring.”\n“You sure about that? Imean, I’llhitthestreets, there’s stuff\noutthere foryounow…” Alan trailed off,notbelieving what he\nwassaying andletting that come through. Being polite wasn’t\nAlan’s strongest characteristic, buthe’d never been inthispos-\nition with Howard—Howard Kessler, thebiggest star tocome\nout of Brooklyn since DeNiro. Except DeNiro is from the Bronx.\nHoward’s prejudice against overexposing himself waned in\nthepast year orso.Hedidtoomany films, toomany awards\nshows. Hehired anew personal trainer and stepped uphis\nroutine, cutoutmeat, started doing some yoga. Allwith the\ngoal ofgetting some perspective, growing younger, changing\nthescenery abit.None ofitwasworking andHoward wasget-\ntingincreasingly depressed. Hehated L.A.Thousands ofactors\ndesperately jockeying forposition forthenext role, and who\nwould replace anidollikeHoward intenseconds flat. There\nwere noroots inL.A.Howard’s feelings about thecitywere ad-\nmittedly stereotypical—the town hasnosoul, itsucks thecre-\nativity outofyou, it’splastic, desperate, superficial, andutterly\n4\nhopeless forallbutatiny fraction ofthepopulous. Forsome\nreason it never felt as heavy as it does now.\nLater that evening, Nancy came home andwithout even ask-\ningwhy thehouse wasn’t packed with strangers, friends, and\nother stars, proceeded to ask for Howard’s full attention.\n“Ifellinlove with someone else,” shestated, simply and\nassertively.\nAfter apainfully long pause, without breaking eyecontact,\nHoward responded, “Are you fucking kidding me? Isthis a\njoke? Doyouhave anyidea what ashitty fucking dayIjust\nhad? And now this? What the fuck are you trying to do to me?”\n“I’m sorry, Ireally am. Idon’t know what happened,” she\nsaid without remorse.\n“You been fucking this guy foralong time? Because that\nwould really piss me off.”\n“No. Yes. Not really.”\n“Seven years, Nancy, seven fucking years.”\nHefeltlike heought tobemore upset. Abomb like this\nshould have more aftershock. Butwith allhe’s been through,\nhemay have been expecting ittohappen. It’snotlikeNancy\nwasthelove ofhislife.Shewasnoovernight fling, butNancy\nwas oneofthefewwomen who could take Howard’s lifestyle,\nhispast, hisfuture, andhisdistant demeanor with astride, and\ndidn’t seem towant anything more from himthan companion-\nship andtheoccasional triptoFiji.Nancy wascurrently arel-\natively successful make-up artist; andhadbeen aformer model\nand severe cocaine addict inanother lifetime. She was\nmarkedly younger than Howard, butstillnotyoung—at least by\nL.A. standards. They made agood pair. When they attended\nopenings orgalas, Howard didn’t manage herevery move; and\nbythesecond drink, they were offsocializing atother sides of\ntheroom. Shehadherfriends andhehadhisfolk. Itwasade-\ncent balance.\n“Get thefuck outta here. Justgetout.Ican’t fucking believe\nthisshit,” asheturned hisback andwalked away from Nancy,\nwho seemed more stunned than Howard.\nHegrabbed hiskeys andleftthehouse before Nancy even\nmade her way upstairs to pack her things.\n* * * *\n5\nHoward’s usual means ofescaping problems istohitthe\nbottle andgotothetrack—two habits hetook andkept with\nhim from Brooklyn toHollywood. Back asakidintheold\nneighborhood, heandhisgang would spend their days ditching\nhigh school and hanging outinthepool room hustling and\nstarting fights. When they didn’t shoot pool well enough tocov-\nertheir bets, they would find amark andeither hustle some\nmore orflat-out robthem. Stores, apartments, businesses were\nalltargets fortheir petty—and sometimes notsopetty—thefts.\nWhen thepressure heightened tocome upwith more money at\nthe pool hall, Howie dug himself deeper into debt with\ndrinking.\nThrough theyears, hisaddiction topills, heroin, cocaine, and\nthen prescription painkillers nearly brought hislifeandcareer\ntoanabrupt stop intheearly 1990s. Alan stepped inandspent\nnearly twoyears handling Howie’s rehab inanexclusive facil-\nityinthedesert outside Palm Springs. Alan’s partnership at\ntheagency came close todisintegrating, buthecouldn’t stand\ntoseehisfriend eaten alive bydrugs. Alan feltthat Howie had\nseen andexperienced enough that hecould kick thehabit and\ngoback tofocusing ontheacting, sohisstrong faith inhis\nfriend pulled them both through. And they both came outbet-\nterforit:Alan wasprofiled inTime magazine forhisheroism in\nsaving theiconic Howard Kessler; and Howie emerged asa\nnewly polished starready forA-list roles written exclusively for\nhim.\nThe two had been unstoppable.\nNotsomuch past theaddiction butover itforthemoment;\nand confounded about what todowith hislifeatthis point,\nHoward feltforthefirst time likethere wasaclarity inhisper-\nspective that heshould betaking advantage of.Hewasn’t dis-\ntracted bylunatic women, drugs, orgambling debts. Hehad\nplenty ofmoney. Hefeltatpeace with somany ofhisdemons.\nWhy couldn’t hejustsettle down andenjoy aquiet retirement?\nWasn’t that what all these signs were pointing to?\nHoward couldn’t just retire. Hehasmore fireand energy\nnow than he’d hadsince hefirst came toL.A. asa22-year old\nhack in 1966 right out of the Navy.\n* * * *\n6\nRalphie, Howard’s stylist andafriend 30years hisjunior, in-\nsisted that thebest wayforHoward toshake offthiscloud was\nto get a tattoo.\n“The lasttime Igotatattoo waswhen IwasintheNavy al-\nmost 50years ago. I’mnotgetting atattoo. I’lllook likeanas-\nshole,” Howard responded.\nTwo hours later they were both sitting intheplush couches\nofoneofL.A.’s most exclusive tattoo artists’ dens, browsing\nthephoto and design books. Ben, anartist from New York,\ncomes outfrom behind thebeads and nearly fellbackwards\nseeing Howard inhiswaiting room. He’s idolized Howard for\nhisroles insome ofthegreatest mob films ever. Ben’s ex-girl-\nfriend’s father grew upwith Howard inBrooklyn, sohehadfol-\nlowed Howard’s career, stumbles, and highlights forseveral\nyears.\n“Uh, sir,um,hi,it’sreally great tohave youhere,” stuttered\nBen.\nHedidn’t want tocrowd thestar, andthere hadbeen many\ncelebrities inhisshop before. Buttohim, Howard Kessler was\nthepinnacle ofstardom, having taken roles that arenow icono-\nclastic and studied in film school.\n“Uh-huh, look kid, I’mnotreally interested inthis stuff—“\nHoward grumbled.\nRalphie stopped Howard.\n“What he’s saying ishe’d likethisscorpion here,” pointing to\nanover-sized flash ofascorpion stinging avoluptuous, naked\nwoman. Ahackneyed image, atbest, Benhadremarked before,\nbut kept it to himself. Howard rolled his eyes.\nRalphie decided onapanther tattoo andHoward passed on\ngetting onedone. While Ben was doing hiswork, Howard sat\nand watched and tinkered on his cellphone.\n“So, Mr. Kessler, um, doyou know aguy from Brooklyn,\nKarol Plotkin?” Ben asked.\nHoward seized andstared straight ahead, hischildhood con-\nsolidated into five seconds. He glared at Ben.\n“Iknow Karol Plotkin. Iknow Punch. How thefuck doyou\nknow him?”\nNo one expects Howie’s responses to be as gruff as they are.\n7\n“I,uh,myex-girlfriend, Jessica, she’s hisdaughter, shemen-\ntioned tomealong while ago—“ hesaid cautiously, hoping to\nnot further agitate the short-tempered Howard.\n“Idon’t fucking believe it.Punch. What thefuck ishedoing\nnow? Where ishe?Youknow, hewas thesmartest guyoutof\nallofus…” Howard reminisced, his words loaded with\nmemories.\n“Idon’t, uh,he’s inNew Jersey Ithink. Retired maybe. He\nwas an executive with a big company or something.”\n“Right, sure, ofcourse. Iheard hewent tocollege. Punch,\nthis guy, Itellyou, hewas fucking crazy. Butsmart. Iknew\nhe’d do something with himself.”\nHoward couldn’t shake thinking about Karol “Punch” Plotkin\nfordays. Thegood times they hadtogether asanadhocgang\ninBrighton Beach wasn’t because they particularly wanted to\nhave agang, butbecause they had tostay together sothey\nwouldn’t catch abeat-down atevery corner they turned. Tough\nneighborhoods spawn tough kids, andthekids found strength\ningangs associated byblock. Howard andPunch hung around\ntogether since they were ingrade school. One ofHoward’s old-\nestmemories with Punch wasinhiding under theboardwalk at\nConey Island looking upgirls’ skirts. They weren’t alone, but\nthey felt like they were the smartest guys on the beach.\nIthadbeen years since Howard hadgiven theolddays back\ninBrooklyn any thought. Herarely looks back, and there’s\nnothing there forhim. Today, thebeach forHoward wasaglor-\nious view hehadfrom hiscapacious deck overlooking thePa-\ncific Ocean, from hismansion inMalibu. AsakidforHoward,\nthebeach was Coney Island’s crowded, sandy thoroughfare.\nHoward lived inatenement with anextended family that was\ntoobusy tocare foratroublesome kid.Punch lived inabase-\nment apartment with hismother who worked three jobs justto\nputenough food onthetable. Shewasn’t around much tosu-\npervise Punch, sothetwokids stirred mayhem from anearly\nage.\nHehadtofindouthow Punch wasdoing. Adaughter. Punch\nhas a daughter. What else does he have?\n8\nChapter 2Clear the Noise and Find Some Truth\nRalphie andHoward went outafter thetattoo andhaddinner\ninatrendy fusion spot andthen ontoaclub with velvet ropes\nandnosigns outdoors. They were whisked inside through an\nunmarked door, and shown toHoward’s table, segregated\naway from everyone else. Howard satthere unimpressed with\nthescene, and feltoutofplace intheplace hecame ona\nweekly basis. Hesaid hishellos, hadafewdrinks, tried toen-\njoyhimself. Ralphie sent over somany women that Howard\ncouldn’t keep track anditdidn’t doathing todistract himfrom\nthefactthat Nancy lefthimjusthours earlier, andhecame to\ntherealization that hiscareer asheknew itwas most likely\ncoming to an end.\nHoward leftearly andreturned home. Ofallthethings, he\ncouldn’t stop thinking about Punch. Hecalled Ralphie tohave\nhimgetintouch with thekidatthetattoo studio toseeabout\ngetting Punch’s phone number.\n* * * *\nAlan made apersonal visit toHoward’s home; quite aschlep\nfrom Beverly/ Fairfax inWest Hollywood toMalibu, buthewas\nworried about hisfriend. Hehadn’t seen him inweeks and\nthough heknew that Howard wasn’t angry with him person-\nally, justwanted reassurances that they were ok.Hebrought\nrugelah from agreat Jewish bakery inL.A. hoping towarm\nHoward upand make him feel better. Howard answered the\ndoor with his usual greeting, a great hug and handshake.\n“What thehelltook yousolong tocome seeme? I’mnota\nfucking leper.”\n9\n“Howie youknow Ilove you. Yousaid youwanted some time.\nOrsome space. Whatever thehellyousaid youwanted Igave it\ntoyou. Ialways give you what you want,” Alan gratefully\nreplied.\n“I’m glad you’re here. We gotta talk.”\n“No word from Nancy?”\n“Nah, theslut. Youknow it’snotreally abigdeal she’s not\nhere anymore. Idon’t miss her. Idon’t miss thecompany. I\ndon’t mind having the quiet around here.”\n“So what are you getting at?” Alan inquired cautiously.\n“Nothing, I’mjust…I’ve been thinking alot.Ithink I’mgoing\nhome.”\n“What, home? Which one? TheIsland? Yacht inAmalfi? You\nwanna stay at my place in Maui for a while?”\n“Alan I’mgoing back toBrooklyn.” Howard stood upand\nmade the pronouncement resolutely.\n“What the fuck isinBrooklyn? Ofallthe places,\nHoward…Are you going through some kind of crisis?”\nThey both laughed at the dramatic effect.\n“You sound like abad screenplay,” Howard joked. “Ijust\nthought I’dgetthehelloutofthistown forawhile. Getback\nto—“\n“What? Getback towhat? There’s nothing there. Noone’s\nleft.Youknow that,” Alan said, knowing thatatriphome forall\nhisclients andfriends never meant anything good. They hadn’t\neven made good movies about thesubject ofgoing back home.\nItwas trite. Going back home was acontrived context totoo\nmany bad stories. Itwas unlike Howard tofallforsuch\nsentimentality.\nHoward satback and basked intheimaginary sun inthe\nenormous living room, soaking inevery detail that hisinterior\ndesigner carefully planned, asiftolook atitforthefirst and\nlast time.\n“Ican’t say Ihave strong attachments here anymore,”\nHoward declared.\nAlan stood upand appeared totake offense. Hepaced\naround alittle bit.Howard didn’t look inhisdirection, butsaw\nhim from thecorner ofhiseyeand heknew hisfriend was\nplanning a counterattack.\n10\n“Attachments? Howard Motherfucking Kessler, Attachments?\nYour whole lifeishere, your career, youwere nothing without\nHollywood anddon’t pretend youwould have made anything of\nyourself without your career inthis town. You don’t attach\nwell, ifyouhadn’t already noticed bynow, youcold fuck,” he\nsteamed. Alan inhaled andwasabout tocontinue thetirade but\nthen Howard interrupted.\n“I’m notsaying that Idon’t appreciate what you’ve done, or\nwhat Ihave. Forchrissake, Alan, thisisa$10million house I’m\nin;youdon’t think Iknow what Ihave? That’s notmypoint. I\ndon’t know what the fuck my point is anymore. I just don’t—“\nAlan knew exactly what Howard was getting at,even ifhe\nhimself didn’t know. And nothing against Howard, Alan knew\nhecouldn’t articulate itanyway. Here’s aguywho wasshrewd\nenough togetwhere heistoday, butbybrute force, talent, and\nintensity, not book smarts.\n“Fine then. Fine, how long doyouwant totake? Imean, you\nknow what happens topeople outhere when they’re offthecir-\ncuit for too long,” Alan tried to keep Howard focused.\n“Idon’t give ashit about thecircuit. I’m66years old. 26\nmovies, countless TVshows, afuckin musical, youthink Igive\nashitabout thecircuit? What elseisthere formehere? Taking\nroles asaGrampa sitting onaporch reading stories toasnot-\nnosed ankle-biter in some schlocky period piece?”\nHe was right.\nHoward was either tooembarrassed orconfused toadmit\nwhat he was really thinking—if anything, Alan thought.\n“You’re toooldtohave kids. They don’t even dothat in\nAfrica,” Alan said bluntly, angry that hecouldn’t dissuade the\nheadstrong Howard.\n“It’s notkids. That ship leftalong time ago. Idon’t know,\nAlan, Ijustdon’t have anything ofmyown. Ikeep playing these\nroles, they’re all the same, I’m tired and bored—“\n“And those tired, boring roles arewhat’s gotten youthis$10\nmillion home,” Alan retorted.\n“Ihave nothing ofmyown, iswhat Iwas going tosay. I\nmean, I’ve made aliving offofacaricature ofmyself, and I\ndon’t have any identity.”\n“Oh, sothat’s what youthink this isabout? Your identity?\nListen tome—I mean it,Howie—listen toevery word I’mgoing\n11\ntotellyou, andnot justbecause Ithink Brooklyn isauseless\npiece ofshitplace, butbecause Iknow youbetter than anyone\nandIcanseefrom amillion miles away that youwere about to\nhit this point—“\n“Idon’t want tohear it.Alan, thank you, really, Iamthankful\nforyour friendship. ButIhave todothis. Ihave togetoutof\nhere, andIjusthave togoback home andseewhat’s there for\nme.”\nHestood upandlooked outattheocean, then turned back\naround andstretched hisarms outtohisside, clasping them\nbehind his neck—pulling rather than hanging his arms.\n“I’ve gotnothing tolose,” Howard said, almost inawhisper,\ntrying to convince himself that it was true.\n“Fine. Ihave strong opinions about this, Howard, I’mjust\ntelling you then. Just one last question though. Are you in\ntrouble? Imean, youknow, thenumbers? Idon’t wanna getan-\nother fucking knock onthedoor at3am byabunch ofanimals,”\nAlan asked, referring tothetime afew years back when\nHoward owed every bookie west of the Hudson.\n“No, I’m good.”\nAnd with that, they bid goodbye.\n* * * *\nAlan leftthehouse andsulked back tohiscarupthesteep\ndriveway. Hewas losing hisfriend. Even ifhecame back,\nwhich hedoubted hewould, things wouldn’t bethesame. Once\nyou’ve turned onL.A., youcan’t come back thesame person\nwho left. Alan couldn’t seeanything good outofHoward’s de-\ncision togoback home. Ithad been 50years and there was\nnothing forhim there. Acouple ofaltakaka’s who used tobe\nhoodlums. Alan’s worst fear isthat going back home would re-\nsuscitate theoldfeuds, orbring outtheparasites who would\nsuck everything outofhisfriend that there istogive—money,\nfirst andforemost, andthepathetic requests tobesetupon\ndates.\nAfewquiet days passed. Howard’s phone rang and itwas\nRalphie with thephone number hewanted from Ben, thetattoo\nartist. Howard wrote itdown ontheback oflastweek’s copy of\nVariety inthick, black marker. Howard didn’t usepen and\n12\npaper much foranything, sowhen hedid, Sharpies were his\nchoice writing tool.\nHe thought he should be clear with Alan, and gave him a call.\n“Alan, buddy, listen, Idon’t think wehadastraight conversa-\ntion the other day,” Howard said sheepishly.\n“What the hell are you talking about now?”\n“About going home. Me, when Isaid I’mgoing back to\nBrooklyn—“\n“Were youshittin’ me? Because ifyouwere that’s aterrible\ntrick, really, Howie—“\n“No, Iknow youhave problems with mydecision. Buthon-\nestly, the first time I thought about it was when we talked.”\nThere wasalong silence. Alan didn’t know whether tolaugh\norhang up.Hehadtoclarify, since Howie wasn’t abigtalker\non the phone.\n“Wait, are you going back or no?”\n“Yeah, I’mprobably going back. Thewhole thing started be-\ncause Ijustheard about aguyIknew, oneofmyclosest friends\nbefore I left, he’s still around and I just, uh—“\n“Alright, I get it, you’re curious. It happens to the best of us.”\n“Idon’t know ifit’sjustcurious, youknow, it’slike, Idon’t\nknow, Ijustwant togetback tosomething Iknow,” Howard\nsaid, though wavering.\n“I’m nottrying totalkyououtofit,butyoualready know my\nfeeling about this. ButIcan’t help buttellyouthat it’sastupid\nfucking idea,” Alan rebuked.\n“Idon’t know ifit’sstupid. Ihave togetthehelloutofhere. I\nhave togolearn something, find some new things, come up\nwith a new project for myself.”\n“Uh, Brooklyn isn’t where yougotolearn stuff andfindnew\nthings, you know, it’s a dead-end.”\n“I’m justtalking about digging upacouple ofguys. Finding\nout what they’ve been doing.”\nAlan had no response.\nLosing patience, Howie said, “Forget it,forget Icalled, I’llbe\nin touch.”\nHehung up.Alan couldn’t change hisfriend’s mind, even if\nhe knew that Howard’s mind wasn’t exactly resolute.\nSeveral days passed before Howard hadthegumption tocall\nPunch. Hedidn’t even know what hewould say. Hedidn’t\n13\nobsess over it,though. Hespent afew days packing some\nclothing, arranging fortheartwork tobesold orsent back to\nthegalleries from which heborrowed them. Hehadacleaning\nservice come in,hisdecorator arranged formuch ofthefur-\nniture tobepacked away, and themanagement agency to\ncome assess theproperty foranextended separation. Howard\ndidn’t even know where hewasgoing. Hisphone used toring\nallday—now only afewcalls adayfrom friends orhispublicist.\nThings were winding down ontheir own, which isjusttheway\nHoward likes it.\nHoward wasn’t going tostick around town tohear gawkers\nwhispering that he’s a has-been.\nRalphie, who was much less ofamensch than Alan, called\nHoward outonBen’s frantic search forPunch’s phone number.\n“What, yougoing back home tobeabigstar there, youdon’t\nget enough of that here?”\n“Idon’t really know what thefuck you’re talking about Ral-\nphie, so you can fuck off.”\nButHoward felthehad tothink about Ralphie’s inartfully-\nsaid message. Was that really why hewas going home? Be-\ncause heknew that hewould getthefawning attention ofa\nNew York audience, hishome-town? Hetried itonce before\nabout 25years agoanditwent over well forawhile until he\noverstayed hiswelcome. Heowed money, waswrapped upina\nhorse-fixing scandal, landed afew punches atone ofNew\nYork’s 3-star restaurants, smashed aborrowed Ferrari and\nnever repaid theowner. Hewas also accosted byeveryone\nwho ever came through Brooklyn, claiming tobehisbest friend\nandinneed ofmoney. Butmost ofall,hisoldfriends always\nwanted himtohook himupwith girls. Most ofthose guys were\nsodesperate forwomen that they feltHowie wasasilver bullet\nfor dates. It was pathetic.\nThis time itwillbedifferent. He’s notgoing back asastar.\nHe’s going back asHowie Kessler, tofindhisfriends, clear the\nnoise, and find some truth.\nHe picked up the phone and dialed Punch’s number.\n14\nChapter 3Punch\n“Hon, the mail’s here,” I said.\n“WHAT? Ican’t hear you! You’re talking butIcan’t hear you!\nWhat?” yelled Adele, my wife of too many years.\nAdele always talks twice asmuch asIdo,attwice the\ndecibel. Mykids always make funofus,asifweorchestrate\nour discombobulated conversations solely for their\nentertainment.\n“It’s alright.

Ihave noleft\nleg.Thedocs took itoffbecause ofsome godawful circulation\nthing caused bydiabetes. Butitwon’t killmetogetthemail.\nSo I open the door and look in the box, but there’s no mail.\n“Oh goddammit, it’s the phone,” I remembered.\n“WHAT?”\n“For CHRISSAKES, Adele, it’s the PHONE. The PHONE!”\nThe doorbell didn’t ring; it was the new cellphone.\n“Karol thephone wasringing, Iwasintheback andcouldn’t\ngetit,”Adele said asshewalked into theliving room looking\nforme.“Where thehellareyou?” sheshouted asIrolled be-\nhind her.\n“Ithought itwasthedoorbell, themail. SoIgotupandwent\nto the door.”\n“So who was on the phone? Who called?” she asked.\n“Isaid Iwent totheGODDAMNED DOOR, notthephone.\nThere’s no mail yet by the way, it’s 3pm.”\nAdele lefttheroom inahuff. Shecame back amoment later\nwith the cellphone and handed it to me.\n15\n“Idon’t have myglasses, soIcan’t see. Why dothey make\nthese things so small? Who reads the numbers so small?”\nIdon’t know who shewas asking. Adele asks questions all\nthetime. It’slikeshethinks God islistening andwillprovide\nheranswer momentarily. She looks upand around toseeif\nanyone hasananswer, butsheknows noone ever actually\ndoes.\n“H.Kessler, itsays. Ihave noidea. It’sawrong number or\nsomething. No one ever calls us on this number anyway.”\nKessler. H.Kessler. Howie? Itcouldn’t be.Boy, that was a\nlong time ago. Icouldn’t stop thinking about thephone call.\nSomething about it—I can’t putmyfinger onit.Would bequite\nacoincidence iftheguyIgrew upwith who’s been ahugely\nsuccessful Hollywood star fordecades. Iwent toschool with\nhim, Howie Kessler. Hewas anoldpalfrom Brooklyn. Along\nway back. Haven’t heard anything about theguypersonally in\n30 years. We used to tear things up as kids.\nAdele andIateaquiet dinner andresorted toourevening\nroutine. Adele reading inthekitchen with apotofdecaf coffee;\nandI’minthedenwatching Law &Order andother copshows\nand doing the crossword. We went up to bed.\n* * * *\n“Oh for chrissake, Adele, it’s that cellphone again.”\n“Well, what doyouwant from me? I’mnotgoing downstairs,\nit’s5:30am. Ifthekids need usthey’ll calltheregular phone.\nIt’s probably a crazy person or something.”\nIthad toHowie; Iknew itatthis point. He’s ontheWest\nCoast. Toomuch ofacoincidence nottobe.Iwonder ifhe’s in\ntrouble? Why thehell would hecall me, then? It’sbeen so\nmany years. And how does hehave ourcellphone number?\nOnly thekids have that number. Wedidn’t answer itandsure\nenough when Ichecked thephone later onthere wasthatsame\nnumber as a missed call.\nAnd then topour onthecoincidence, Ireceived aninvitation\ntomyhigh school 50th reunion inthemail thefollowing day,\nforthefewofusstillaround after thislong. This hadtobewhy\nHowie was calling, butIhadnointention ofattending itthis\nyear. I’minthewheelchair with noleg.It’sbecome nearly im-\npossible togotoseeanopera attheMetafewtimes ayear, so\n16\nIdon’t know how I’mgoing tomaneuver around thecityfor\nthisevent. Wedon’t even seefriends inthecityanymore, it’s\njust too difficult. Both our kids have moved out as well.\nArtRaimi emailed melater that daytoseeifIgottheinvita-\ntion. Heplans ongoing. ArtandIgettogether acouple times\nyear. He’s done well forhimself over theyears, considering\nwhere wecame from. He’s notwithout hisfoibles. Theguyhas\nhadhisrunofbadluck. ButI’msure he’d saythesame about\nme.Fact is,weboth gotoutofBrooklyn andwe’re proud tosay\nwehave. Ihave tobehonest; it’spainful seeing himbecause it\nbrings back rough memories. Wehadgood times together. But\nwehaditrough. Clawing ourway outofpoverty inanimmig-\nrant ghetto wasn’t easy. Most oftheguys weknew either died\nofdrug overdoses, went toprison, orboth. ArtandIareprob-\nably very unique creatures tocome outofthat environment.\nAnd Howie Kessler, but he was different.\nMe, Ihad atough time. Iwas anonly child outofanar-\nranged marriage back inPoland. ThewayIunderstand it—only\nthrough whispers from myaunts after mymother died—is that\nmyparents couldn’t conceive. Once they escaped toAmerica\njustasthings gotreally badinPoland after theGermans in-\nvaded, they went their separate ways. Mymother apparently\ngotknocked up,butshewasn’t living with theguy, and he\nsplit. Shetracks down myfather—ok, notreally myfather, but\nforallintents and purposes here, let’s justcallhim myfath-\ner—when I’mabout three years old.Hehadn’t remarried but\nwas working inapickling joint ontheLower East Side. He\nagreed tosupport herandme,buthisheart was never init.\nWhen Iwas11or12hesplit forgood andmoved toBaltimore\nand opened what was apparently oneofthebiggest pickling\nprocessing plants ontheeastern seaboard. Mymother got\nalong bysewing, doing laundry and other errands forother\npoor people inthebuilding. Later, when Icould open thelock\ntoourapartment bymyself shegotafactory job. She never\nmarried, never dated, anddied anangry, poor, frustrated wo-\nman in her mid-50s.\nSoforme,family ismost important. That’s why thefirst op-\nportunity Ihadtogetoutofthecitywith mywife andraise our\nkids inacivilized environment with good schools andtrees and\nnice people, Idid. Idideverything Icould tomake sure my\n17\nown kids didn’t have toendure what Iwent through. They\ndidn’t, andthey turned outgreat. Ilearned that theenviron-\nment really does have animpact onwho youturn outtobeas\nanadult. Irecognize thatsounds simple, orsimple-minded. But\nescaping those roots is not easy.\nLike with Howie, forexample. Here’s aguywho acted out\nclearly because hegotnoattention athome. There were about\n48relatives intheKessler clan living inwhat should have been\nafive-room apartment. Idon’t even think Howie knew thedif-\nference between hiscousins and brothers and sisters—they\nwere allthesame. This wasn’t acommune orasituation outof\nlove; itwas just abunch ofpoor immigrants shacked upin\ntight quarters because they had tobe.Onthehigh holidays\nand forPassover Seders they actually pooled together some\nmoney andrented thebasement oftheShuel, because other-\nwise they hadtoeatinshifts intheapartment. Howie couldn’t\nwait togetoutofhisapartment andcreate hisown identity out\nintheworld. Once hefound acting—or, more accurately, once\nacting found him—he truly found hisidentity andthrived. But\ntheguy had tobethecenter ofattention during anysocial\nevent. Even when wewere engaging inillicit activities, Howie\nsomehow made his voice prominently heard.\n* * * *\nThree weeks later, Imetupwith ArtattheMarriott Millenni-\numHotel inNew York City fortheLincoln High School alumni\nevent. Mywife dropped meoffand she went dinner with\nfriends andwould pick meup.Since weonly hadonecellphone\nbetween us,shekept itandleftmetoborrow Art’s totellher\nwhen topick meup.I’mnothopeful, since shecan’t hear the\ngoddamned thing ring, andwhen it’sburied atthebottom of\nher gargantuan purse it can take a year to dig it out.\nWe’ve gone tothese things before. Ourhigh school, Lincoln\ninConey Island, ishuge. There were somany people who\ngraduated that after 50years, it’shard toremember your\nfriends, noless people younever really knew back then. But\nit’snice totalkabout thegood times andseewhat people are\ndoing. And now, after this long, it’samatter ofseeing what\n18\npeople have already done, since nooneisdoing much atour\nage any more.\nI’ve spent mylifetrying toescape from Brooklyn. Ididn’t\neven enjoy that reunion lastweek. Allofasudden we—my con-\ntemporaries andpeers—are dropping likeflies. We’re old,de-\ncrepit. What arewereunioning for? What thehell’s thepoint,\nanymore? Ifwedon’t seethese people onaregular basis, what\ncould wepossibly talk about after allthese years? What, the\nsock-hops? Thebaseball games atEbbets orthePolo Grounds?\nIdon’t really give ashitabout their grown-up kids now, andI\ncould care even less about their grandkids. Unless they’re a\nquarterback fortheNYGiants orsitting intheWhite House,\nnothing about anyone’s kids isremotely interesting tome.Who\nwants to hear more problems?\nArtgratefully metmeatthedoor, sohecould help rollmein-\ntotheballroom. Thelasttime wewent tooneofthese things it\nwas10years ago. Ithink Artmade theone5years ago. Iwas\nhaving realhealth troubles then, soIdidn’t go.Thevestiges of\nouryouth areindeed gone. Weareallold, crumbling souls\nnow. Ah, fuck it.\nIhesitated tobring upthemystery callonthephone. Ican’t\nkeep my mouth shut, though.\n“You know, Ithink Howie Kessler called mealittle while\nback.”\n“Howie Kessler? Our Howie? Areyoukidding me? What in\ngod’s name could hewant?” How many years hasitbeen?” Art\nasked.\nWhat could Isayafter that? Ididn’t want tomake abigdeal.\nBut it was.\n“What’d he call you for?” he asked again.\n“Ididn’t speak tohim. I’mnotsure itwas him. Was afew\nmissed calls on the cellphone.”\n“Of course it was Howie. Why didn’t you call him back?”\n“He didn’t leave anumber.” Ipaused awhile. “Idon’t know\nhow to check the messages anyway.”\n“Let’s callhimnow. Youhave hisnumber?” Artsaid. What I\ndidn’t immediately realize was that Arthadafewinhimand\nwasn’t really himself. He’s abigguy, soyoudon’t notice itun-\ntil he starts slurring his words.\n19\n“No, Adele hasthephone. Ihave tocallherwith your phone\nto pick me up when we get out of here later.”\nIregretted bringing itupaltogether. Itseemed tocast apall\nonourtable, andbetween Artandme.Everyone wasthinking\nindependently oftheir memories ofHowie, converging with the\nmedia reports, hismovie roles, and everything else youhear\nabout famous people. Itwas justsuch amystery, though, why\nsomeone who hasbeen outofcontact forsomany years would\npick up the phone now. And why me? Why not Frankie?\nIthought about itforabit.Art’s relationship with Howie was\nnever allthat great. They used togetinfights even though we\nwere allapart ofthesame gang. Itwas always over girls.\nHowie dated someone andArtstole heraway. Artwas dating\nsomeone and Howie stole heraway. Sometimes Ithink they\nused to date girls just to instigate one another.\nArthad aserious look ofconcern, “Ihope he’s not in\ntrouble.”\n“Let’s gogetsome shrimp before these fatoldbastards eat\nthem all,” I said to Art, hoping to change the subject.\n* * * *\nI’lltellyounow that I’mplanning oncalling Howie, butI\nwon’t doitalone. The suspense iskilling me,though Ican’t\npossibly imagine why after allthese years hewould tryand\ntrack medown. Iowe ittoArttorope himin.Icalled Artand\nleft a message.\n“Art, uh,thisisPunch, listen, Ifound Howie’s phone number,\nandIthink weshould callhim. Together. Give meacallback,\norcome onbythehouse thisweekend. Youknow me,I’mnot\ngoing anywhere these days.”\nIhoped hewould callright back andgive meallthereasons\nintheworld nottocallHowie back. Isatinmychair inthe\nsunroom and thought ofevery single reason why nottocall\nHowie. I sat there a long time thinking about the old days.\nIwas abigkid.Imean, Iwas tall, built, bigger than allour\nfriends. Howie wasshorter than usall—he wasarealscrapper.\nHowie stole mybike when wewere ingrade school. When I\nwent tohisapartment building andthrew arock inhiswindow\nwith anote onittelling himtogive mybike back, hecame up\n20\nandpunched meintheface. That’s how Igotthename Punch.\nYou’d think that mynickname would beforthrowing the\npunch, which Isoon learned todoquite effectively. Butfrom\nthen on,somehow, wehad amutual respect foroneanother\nand that sustained our relationship.\nLater onwhen weallgotolder andwe’d start fights with oth-\nergangs, Howie would always throw thefirst punch andthen\nrun like hell. That would always leave me, thebiggest kid\naround, togive and take thebeat-downs. Inever gottotell\nHowie that after awhile, thiswasn’t funanymore, anditbe-\ncame kind ofpredictable. Butthen within minutes after high\nschool graduation, I never saw Howie again.\nIcan’t believe hejustranoutofthere, justlikethat. How\ncould heleave allofusafter allwe’d been through together?\nIt’sbeen aquestion running through mymind foryears and\nthough Iunderstand thedesire toleave poverty, struggle, and\ntheghetto, keeping onwith therelationships isn’t theworst\nthing intheworld. You can’t escape your own lifeand iden-\ntity—it’s always there, nomatter how much youtrytomask it.\nHowie may beagreat actor andashamed ofhispast enough to\nforget about hisupbringing; butthefewroles he’s taken that\nveer toofaroutside hisrealm ofexperience have been bombs. I\nmean, hetried tobeaBritish ship captain inthe1700s insome\nmovie anditwas ridiculous. Literally ajoke. Inanother artsy-\nfartsy piece hetried toplay therole ofagayCanadian cellist\nandagain, noonebought it.Buthetried—sure asshithetried\nto shed the Brooklyn hoodlum typecast.\nAfter allthese years offestering resentment that Ihadjust\nrealized was there after anafternoon ofcontemplation inthe\nsunroom, Istill decided topursue thephone callalong with\nArt.\nArt,godbless him, hasitbetter than most ofusatthispoint\nafter quite adramatic breakup with hiswife. Hiskids don’t\neven talktohimanymore. It’sheartbreaking. Buttheguyliter-\nallyistheboss ofbaseball. He’s busted hisassallthese years,\ntraveling, negotiating, andknowing thegame, players, owners\nandmedia inside andoutlikenone other inhistory. Hewas a\nlittle younger than usguys, ayear ortwo, sohewas\nsmart—with thebooks andonthestreets. HegotoutofBrook-\nlyninahurry after high school andbroke hisassworking for\n21\ntheNew York Yankees. Started outcleaning upspit; now he’s\nslated tobecome the next commissioner ofbaseball, that\nsonofabitch.\nWhen Ithink about what losers most ofuswere; how much\ntrouble wecaused; how little guidance wehad, it’samazing\nanyofusgotoutofthere alive. Come tothink ofit,acouple of\nushave done ok.Imean, there’s Howie, ofcourse. Ididwell\nenough, worked asanengineer AT&T fornearly 40years be-\nfore they lopped offmyleg.Well enough that Ihaven’t hadto\nlook back.\nFrankie, well, Idon’t know what Frankie’s upto,butIknow\nhehadanice business going forawhile inconstruction, until\nthe mob found out hewas skimming. Frankie wasn’t the\nsmartest guy, buthewas generally agood guyandlikable. I\ndon’t know what ever happened to Frankie.\nAnd then there’s Mo, who, ifhe’s alive today, isamiracle.\nThis guywas thebiggest troublemaker ofallofus.Henever\neven intended ongetting outofBrooklyn. Brooklyn gave him\neverything heneeded—entertainment, girls, drugs, gambling,\nConey Island. Idon’t think Moever leftBrooklyn, though I\ndon’t know forsure. Iheard hemay have been inprison fora\nwhile, drugs or something. Mo’s a survivor.\nWe’re allsurvivors. Itwasafucking jungle back then where\nwe came from. A fucking jungle.\n22\nChapter 4Art\n“Art, uh,thisisPunch, listen, Ifound Howie’s phone number,\nandIthink weshould callhim. Together. Give meacallback,\norcome onbythehouse thisweekend. Youknow me,I’mnot\ngoing anywhere these days.”\nIdidn’t want totellYuri about theconversation Ihadwith\nPunch about Howie calling him, and allthe memories it\nbrought back. Butwhen Iheard Punch’s message, Icouldn’t\nkeep itfrom Yuri. Yuri andIhave been together for10years.\nIt’swhat precipitated mydivorce from mywife. Nooneknows\nabout ourrelationship. I’mgoing tobethenext commissioner\nofbaseball. How many commissioners aregay? Nooneeven\nknows I’mgay. Ididn’t even know Iwasgay. Alright, Iguess I\ndid.Ithink theonly onewho might have aclue would beHow-\nie, so there’s a reason I don’t want him in my life again.\nAtalatedinner ending ahectic week oftravelling andwork,\nIthought Iwould drop thiswhole thing onYuri andgetitover\nwith.\n“Ithought wecould hang around thisweekend andcheck out\nsome exhibits downtown. Areyouworking orcanwerelax fora\nwhile; wehaven’t had areal day inthecity together fora\nwhile,” Yuri asked.\n“Iguess now’s asgood atime asanytotellyouwhat Ihad\nplanned for tomorrow—“\n“Oh, Art,Idon’t likethis,” Yuri said asheplunked down his\nfork.\n“No, it’snotbad. Listen, thehigh school reunion Iwent toa\nwhile back, with Punch—Karol—Plotkin, wegottothinking,\nsee—“\nYuri stopped methere. Hegotupfrom thetable andturned\nhisback, “You can’t goback, Art. Look atyou. You can’t go\n23\nback,” Yuri said, with asense ofdefeat andpessimism inhis\nvoice.\n“It’s Howie Kessler. Ithink he’s introuble orsomething. He\ncalled Punch, but didn’t leave a message. It’s been decades.”\n“So why don’t you ignore it?What’s this allofasudden\nyou’re interested inyour past—an inglorious oneatthat? How-\niecan’t begetting intouch foraltruism. Hemust need\nsomething.”\n“You don’t know Howie—“\n“Art, you don’t know Howie. Have you even counted how\nmany years it’sbeen? You have noidea who thisguyis.You\nranaround askids andthat was50years ago. FIFTY years, old\nman.”\nIstopped foramoment. Iwas remembering Howie asa\nsmooth-talking hustler inhigh school; Ihadn’t even thought\nabout hisaging and career—and adulthood. Then Ithought\nabout how much I resented the guy.\n“I don’t know. You’re right. Maybe I’m just curious.”\n“That kind ofcurious canonly getyouintrouble. Let’s talk\nabout my day.”\nBut because I’m astubborn oldbastard, Iwent out to\nPunch’s house thenext morning anyway. Yuri sulked and\nwarned mehewould told-ya-so mewhen Igetdisappointed by\ndigging upthepast. Hecouldn’t bemore correct inhisassess-\nment ofmyapproach andthesituation. There’s areason why I\namsuccessful though, andpart ofitisinpursuing ideas until I\namcertain they aredead. Once dead, then Imove ontothe\nnext one. I couldn’t let this one die without exploring it further.\nI’mabusy guy. Ihave alotgoing on.Iwork 80hour weeks\nbecause Iliketo.Keeping busy isthekeytomysuccess andI\nintend onkeeping itthat way. ButHowie had re-entered my\nmind, andallthese years Ihadwondered what Iwould sayto\nhim when I saw him once again. Now I could have my chance.\nIknocked onthedoor andwaited awhile, realizing Ishould\nusethedoorbell forsomeone inArt’s house tohear me.Itwas\nvery early onthisSaturday morning. Iwake uparound 5:30am\nandstart mydayearly. Ipaced around theapartment before\ncalling thegarage forthecarat7:15am andrushed outtoNew\nJersey. There was zero traffic and Imade itthere inrecord\n24\ntime. Afewmore knocks andading, andfinally, ayoung man\ncame to the door, must be Punch’s older son.\n“Hi, can I help you?” he said.\n“ I’m Art Raimi, an old friend of your father’s—”\n“Oh, right! Youguys went tothereunion together lastweek!\nIremember. Gosh, youguys were friends when youwere kids,\nright?”\n“Yeah, yeah, part oftheoldgang. Your dad asked meto\ncome by this weekend, I hope now’s not a bad time?”\n“No, ofcourse not, come onin.Wewere just doing some\nphysical therapy. It’sgreat tofinally meet you, Imean, you\nknow, I’ve heard about you for years.”\nHemust have seen myquizzical look. I’mnotvery good at\nhiding myexpressions, soItrynottoputmyself insituations\nwhere my vulnerabilities will be read by someone.\n“For hisamputation, youknow, there’s stilltherapy hehasto\ndoinorder tomaintain healthy circulation andblood pressure,\nmaintenance of the stump, prosthesis—“\nI couldn’t listen to the rest.\n“Right, of course, sure. The leg.” My eyes darted away.\nArtwastheathletic oneinhigh school. Heplayed fortheLin-\ncoln High School basketball team before hewas kicked offin\nhissenior year. Ican’t remember why. Hewould have hada\ngood chance atgoing tocollege forhisballplaying, Ithink. He\ngotinto toomuch trouble with us.Iwanted tobetheathlete,\nbutIjustdidn’t have it.SoIhelped ourlittle gang earn some\nmoney running numbers and taking bets. Ifollowed allthe\nsports around, professional down toourhigh school. Iloved\nbeing around sports. Later Ilearned that Iloved being around\nthe athletes, too.\nArt’s kidbrought meinto theexercise room. Hewas laying\nonthefloor onamatwearing gym shorts holding oneofthose\ngiant gym balls. There was only oneleg. Itunderscored the\nfactthat hedidn’t have aleg.Itsounds ridiculous, butseeing\nhim inthe wheelchair was easier than seeing him help-\nless—legless—on thefloor that day. Artrealized how awkward\nitwasformetoseehimlikethat. Hetried nottoscowl athis\nson, who was his physical therapist as well.\n“I’m sorry, letmecome back later, Ididn’t realize youwere\nin the middle of—I should have called—“\n25\n“No, notatall.Justgive meaminute. Josh, arewethrough?”\nArt asked, somewhat feebly.\n“Sure Dad, wecangettotheother stuff later. I’llbearound\nallday. Mom asked metohelp herhang some curtains or\nsomething upstairs. Stacy’s coming bywith thekids at5.”He\nhoisted hisfather back intothewheelchair, rolled upthemat,\nand dutifully left the room.\n“I’m sorry youhadtoseemelikethis,” Artsaid, looking at\nthe floor.\nIhadnothing tosay. Myoldest friend intheworld whom I\ncared for deeply was suffering terribly, I could see it.\n“Itwould have been worse ifthediabetes gotyoubefore they\ngot the leg off,” I said, authoritatively.\n“I dunno. This is bullshit. I don’t want to talk about it.”\nHewheeled outoftheroom into theden, where Ifollowed\nhim and satdown. Artpicked uphiscellphone and fumbled\nwith it for a bit.\n“I’m calling him right now. Might as well just do it.”\n“Yep,” I agreed.\nIhoped hewouldn’t answer. Ihoped thenumber would be\nwrong. Ihoped Punch would have lostthegumption tocallhim\nback.\nPunch’s hand was shaking. Icouldn’t imagine hewas this\nnervous orapprehensive about calling Howie onthetelephone.\nBefore Icould even askifhewas alright, Punch dropped the\nphone andlooked atmewith ablank stare. Hestarted tocol-\nlapse forward outofhischair. Ishouted forhelp asIsupported\nhimfrom falling from thechair while holding uphishead. Ihad\nno idea what I was doing, and was terrified for my sick friend.\nHours later andatriptotheE.R., Punch was better andit\nwas just aminor scare from aninsulin imbalance. Everyone\naround him knew andunderstood what was happening, butI\nhadnever seen such anepisode anditscared theshitoutof\nme.\n“Isthisgetting old?” Isaid toPunch inthecarontheway\nback to his home, trying some attempt at levity.\n“No, actually, it’sthefucking disease and mygoddamned\nyears ofeating sour cream andbreakfast, borscht andblintzes\nforlunch and dinner and that’s killing menow. Old? Idon’t\n26\nworry about old. We’re already older than ourparents were\nwhen they died.”\nPunch hadabeautiful way ofbreaking down theworld into\neasy, digestible parts. ToPunch, nothing seemed complicated\norinsurmountable. Even though heattributes this cool de-\nmeanor toyears asanengineer, Ireminded himthat he’s al-\nways been this way.\nAskids, Punch would never getriled uptheway wewould.\nHewould dissect thesituation andcome outwith options for\nus.When weknew arival gang would becoming into our\nneighborhood—say, foragirl, orjust toinstigate—we would\nleave ittoPunch todevise aplan. And when itlooked likewe\nwould begetting ourasses kicked, Punch would always come\noutstraight and tellusweneed tobeprepared; and toput\nsome extra heavy rocks in socks.\nSotoseehimteeter ontheedge likeIjustdidfrightened the\nhelloutofme.How amIgoing toreact when mybody starts\nbreaking down? Ican most definitely saynotascalmly as\nPunch justdid.Itinfuriates meifIcan’t control asituation. For\nPunch, hetakes itallinanddeals with itonestep atatime.\nHe’s always been that way; even when faced with such enorm-\nous adversity, like the wheelchair and the disease now.\n“Alright, we’re back, let’s getthisthing over with andfind\nout what the hell’s going on with Howie. I’m curious as hell.”\n“Punch, really, youshould rest. I’mjust going tohead out\nand we’ll dothis another time.” Bythis point, Ihad actually\ngotten excited about calling Howie, butIdidn’t want toadmit\nit.\n“Nah, youkidding? Youschlep alltheway outhere totake\nmetothegoddamned ER? Hand methephone. We're calling\nthis bastard right now. Howie Kessler, you're on the list.”\n27\nChapter 5Howard\nAlan drove byHoward’s house every couple ofdays; and in\nbetween hehad someone from hisoffice drive byand make\nsure Howard was stillintown. Hedidn’t want tokeep calling\nhim. Alan’s plans forHoward were upintheair.He’s hadcli-\nents who claim tomake decisions toleave thebusiness; or\nhave been driven outofthebusiness—only tohave circum-\nstances change overnight. Sohenever counted anyone outun-\ntilthey were actually outofthepicture. Hedidnotthink\nHoward would actually follow through—especially with theex-\ntended stay intheMalibu home. Theonly thing different this\ntime wasthat Howard didn’t seclude himself orexile himself to\navacation destination such ashisprivate island. Hewas just\nbeing Howard, butwithout theentourage. Alan had noidea\nwhat to do next.\nHoward spent three weeks holed upinhiscavernous house,\npiled with boxes, nothing onthewalls, halfthefurniture gone.\nHelived onthecouch infront ofthe60”flatscreen mounted\nonthewall, adjacent tothe14footglass windows overlooking\nthePacific. Shirtless and wearing Adidas athletic pants, his\naging body wastoned andtanned well—a Hollywood torso. He\nkept active andranupanddown thebeach formiles each day.\nHedidn’t read books. Hewent outeach daytopick upthe\nDaily Racing Form andkept upwith theraces, butdidn’t place\nmany bets. Byallaccounts, Howard wasn’t depressed; just\ndisconnected.\nHekept busy anddidn’t lethimself become bored. Hewas\nnotrelaxed, butherarely ever is.Howard feltedgy. Hewas\nwaiting forsomething andhedidn’t know what. Hisability to\nmask histhoughts and feelings was worthy oftheGolden\nGlobes hewon. Hedodges emotional probes with hisabrasive\n28\nreproach, sohehasnever been able toachieve atruly healthy\nrelationship with awoman, oreven with close friends, unless\nthey canread him—a rare skill. Alan read him. Nancy didn’t\nread him, butshedidn’t care. Theonly people inhislifewho\ncould read him were the old gang and his mother.\nMrs. Rebecca Kessler passed away before Howard really\ntouched stardom. Hehad been inafewsmall films and had\ndone some stage work, butin1975 Howard wasn’t exactly a\nhousehold name. Hisbreakout film was in1977 when here-\nceived national attention fortheOscar-winning Kiss &Tell.\nHoward’s mother couldn’t understand Howard’s move toHolly-\nwood. She recognized there were movies and actors and a\nwhole industry, butitwasabsolutely inconceivable toherthat\nhersonwould beapart ofit.And since hisfilms andhiswork\nnever made ittoBrooklyn bythetime shedied, shenever actu-\nallybelieved hewas atwork toachieve thegreatness that he\ndid.Heflew herouttoLosAngeles in1974 forapremiere of\noneofhisfilms; butshewouldn’t leave themotel. Shetook the\nbusback toNew York after three days ontheWest Coast. They\nnever saw each other again.\nHoward was ano-bullshit guy, but hehad Hollywood\nwrapped around hisfinger foragood stretch throughout his\ncareer. Whether heplayed theBrooklyn tough-guy fortheac-\ncolades, orifheactually was theBrooklyn tough-guy was un-\nimportant, because inthistown youarewhat youappear tobe,\nand that’s that.\nOne morning ontheway back from picking uptheDRF, he\nstopped inataStarbucks and satdown toread through the\npicks fortheday. With dark glasses onand abaseball cap,\nHoward was stillquite recognizable; butthistime, hewasn’t\nlooking toberecognized. Losing focus onthehorses andwon-\ndering what thehellhewasdoing with himself, hiseyes drifted\ntoward acouple ofvery young kids with their mother and\ngrandfather, sitting inone ofthecozy seats bythewindow.\nHoward caught theolder gentleman’s eyeforabrief moment.\nIntheman’s face, Howard saw contentment that hehimself\nfeltthat hadnever experienced. Hewatched asthefamily left\nthecoffee place, with thekids holding ontotheir special\ndrinks with large straws andcolorful cups. Mom hoisted each\nkidintotheir carseat, andGramps helped tobuckle each one\n29\nin.Hekissed each kidontheforehead andhanded alittle toy\ntoeach from hispocket before shutting each door. Hewalked\nback around thecartoMom’s side andkissed herandspoke\nforafewmoments. Laughing andholding hands, hestepped\nback while Mom backed thecaroutofthespot slowly. Asthe\nwheels slowly turned andthecarstraightened outofthespot,\nGramps waved andmade faces atthekids who made sillyfaces\nand waved back at him.\nHoward thought about what thiswhole scene would look like\nonscreen—his character isseized with enormous thoughts of\nregret, dread, mortality. Itwastrite. Confused andwith nopa-\ntience forit,hetried tofocus back ontheracing picks forthe\nday. Hecouldn’t. Hefeltcompelled toreturn toBrooklyn tore-\ncapture theconnection and theidentity hefelthe’d lost all\nthese years spent inHollywood, inalifehenever heexpected\nhecould have. The questions hefelthewas avoiding forthe\npast several weeks he was in this funk flooded his mind.\nSowasthatit,identity? Allhehadtogoonwashisacting ca-\nreer, since hehadnothing else tolook back andjudge hislife.\nHebroke itdown: thesuccessful roles he’s played have been\nthose characters heknows well. The unsuccessful ones were\ncharacters hedidn’t know and had never encountered. What\ndoes that sayabout hislifeexperience? Ishelimited? Ishenot\nasworldly ashethought hewas? IshestilltheBrooklyn schlub\nhe’s been trying to escape his whole life?\nSitting inthecoffee shop, Howard refused tobeacaptive of\nhisown depressing questions. Asalways, when heisfaced with\nquestions oratacrossroads, hemakes adecision andsees it\nthrough.\nHedrove back tothehouse with resolve, aiming topack up\nsome things andjustdrive back toNew York. Ashepulled into\nthe circular driveway, his phone rang.\n30\nChapter 6The Phone Call\nItwas a201 area code, and Howard didn’t give amoment’s\nthought towho else itcould have been other than Punch.\nWhere’s themystery anylonger, Howard thought, with cell-\nphones and caller ID?\n“Punch, that you?” heasked quickly, asiftosay, ifit’snot\nPunch, I don’t have time to talk to you so get off my line.\n“Howie Kessler? Howie? It’s Punch Plotkin! How are ya!”\n“Ican’t believe it,Punch, it’sbeen somany years. Yousound\nlike an old man on the phone!”\n“You! You’re theoldman, Howie! You’ve lived athousand\nlives already. Ican’t believe you—a movie star! We’ve watched\nmost ofyour movies. You had some weird ones there, you\nknow.”\n“Yeah, some weird ones. Ilikedoing theoffbeat films; the\npeople are interesting to work with.”\nThere was ashort pause, and another voice ontheline, a\nquieter one.\n“Howie, it’s,it’sme,Art.ArtRaimi. I’m,uh,here with Punch.\nWe got together—“\n“Well holy shit, ArtRaimi! Ican’t believe it’syou. Ican’t be-\nlieve I’mtalking toyouguys both. I’mjust, youknow, over-\nwhelmed Iguess.” Howard was choked up.Hewas about to\nlose hiscool and heknew it.Finally, after somany years of\nputting onhisHollywood front, hewas okwith letting his\nguard down. These were his guys.\n“I’m coming back toNew York. I’mcoming back andIwant\ntoseeyou. I’mstaying. I’mleaving L.A. andIdunno, I’mjust\ndone with it out here.”\n31\nPunch and Artlooked ateach other, hoping theother one\nwould have something tosaytolead theconversation inadir-\nection that was agreeable to both.\nArtsaid, “You’re notintrouble, Howie, right? Imean, we\nwere a little concerned when Punch said—“\nPunch stopped Artthere, notwanting Howie toknow how\nmuch deliberation had gone into the phone call.\n“Howie wecan’t wait foryou tocome back. Ihave kids,\ngrandkids, IliveinJersey now, gotoutofBrooklyn. You just\ntell uswhen you’re back and we’ll arrange adinner or\nsomething. Wecanbarbeque,” Punch said, trying toease up\nany tension that was already developing.\n“Ah, youguys aregreat. Imean, it’sbeen ahundred years\nalready and I feel like I never left.”\nToArt,those words burned; Howard feltthetautness ofthe\ndiscussion.\n“Listen, I’mpacking upmyplace right now. I’llcallyouwhen\nIgetcloser. Punch you’re inJersey, soI’llhitthat before Iget\nto the city. I’ll stop by.”\n“You’re driving?” Punch asked.\n“Yeah, Ijustcan’t flyanymore. Idunno. Ifeelmore connec-\ntedwhen Idrive. Should beaweek orso.Maybe less. Hey you\nguys hear atallfrom Frank andMo? Youknow what they’re up\nto?”\nFrank and Mo.\nThe two names hadn’t been uttered in decades.\n“Jeeeezus, Howie, no,asamatter offact, Ihave noidea\nwhere thehell those guys are,” Punch said, looking outthe\nfront window thinking ofoneofthelastmemories ofthefive\nguys together, smoking cigarettes, drinking booze onthe\nrooftop ofMo’s mother’s apartment house, thenight before\ngraduation, 1962.\n“Art, what are you doing these days?” Howard asked.\n“I’m, uh,I’mstillinbaseball—“ andbefore hehadachance\ntosayhewas going tobethenext Commissioner, Howard\njumped in.\n“Not aballboy, still, huh? Alright, guys, thisisgreat. Ihave\nyour number, Punch. Listen, I’llbeoutthere soon. Keep alight\non.”\n32\nItwasabizarre conversation. Howard feltlikethetrain was\nmoving before hehadachance toboard it.Hefully knew he\nhadn’t thought this through but wasn’t afraid ofthecon-\nsequences since hewas confident that whatever next step he\ntook inlifewould nethimbenefits. Staying inL.A. andhoping\nfor good roles was not going to give him any fulfillment.\nHoward was resolute inreturning toBrooklyn, butafter a\nfew minutes oftalking tohistwo closest and oldest friends\nfrom hisadolescence, hefeltmore distant than ever. They\nwere strangers. What good could possibly come from avisit\nwith these guys other than anevening ofdigging upold\nmemories, he thought?\n33\nChapter 7Art\nIwouldn’t know how tofindFrank andMoifmylifedepended\nonit,Ithought. I’mnoteven sure Iwant tofindoutwhere they\nareand what they’re doing. These guys were bad guys. We\nwere friends outofnecessity. With Frank, itwas likewalking\noneggshells. Histemper wasshorter than Howie’s andhewas\nlikeafreight-train ofanger andviolence. Frank beat onanyone\nhecould given theopportunity, fornoapparent reason. Hewas\nafunny guy, don’t getmewrong, weloved having himaround,\nbut he was a gorilla.\nMo,well, he’s justafuck-up andmakes hisway through life,\nI’msure, wheeling anddealing. What killed meabout Mowas\nthat hewas thesmartest businessman ofallofus.Icould do\nthenumbers. Punch would dotheplanning. Howie was the\nbravado. Frank, thebrawn. And Mo,hewasthebrains behind\nevery scheme weever hatched. Henever hadaguiding light,\nthough, toshow him how tousethose skills outside ofpetty\ncrime. Neither didI,butIhadaseething ambition togetthe\nhell out of the Brooklyn ghetto and I focused it on baseball.\nIcan’t believe Punch wasascalm ashewasduring thecall.\nHours before, hewas nearly comatose intheERand didn’t\neven feeltheneed tobring ituponthecall. Hedidn’t tellHow-\niehehasonly onelegnow. Iwanted totellHowie, sothat ifhe\nsees Punch hedoesn’t gointoshock. Butafter allthese years,\nit would be crazy to expect things to be the same.\nIt’sfunny, we’ll allrecognize Howie because we’ve watched\nhiminthemovies. Forus,we’re justoldmen. Wegotold,fat,\nbald, andinPunch’s case, lostalegalong theway. What the\nhelldoes Howie want with us,anyway? Ihave enough hangers\nonandI’mnoteven famous, yet.Howie, theguycanhave any-\nthing hewants. Hedoes have everything hewants. Why ishe\n34\ncoming back? Ishehaving oneofthose crisis points inlife?\nMine came tenyears agowhen Idivorced Sarah, mywife of30\nyears and mother ofmythree kids; none ofwhom speak to\nme—either Iwasaterrible father traveling 40weeks ayear, or\nbecause Ilefttheir mother foragay, Russian lover. Ihope for\nHowie’s sake he doesn’t have that much on the line.\nIcouldn’t hang onthisanymore today. This isaridiculous\nconsideration thatHowie Kessler iscoming back toBrooklyn to\nseek outhisfriends after nearly ahalf century ofnocontact.\nThere’s got to be more to this.\n“Buddy Igotta getback tothecity. Ihave anearly confer-\nence calltomorrow toprepare foranonslaught ofPlayers As-\nsociation complaints onMonday. Thank youforputting thisto-\ngether.” Isaid toArt, holding hisarm andnotwanting tolet\ngo—partly outofmyown fear ofwhat hehad experienced\ntoday.\nButIwasn’t even sure what Imeant bythat statement. What\nwas Ithanking himfor? Forinviting meouttoNew Jersey to\ngotothehospital with hisfamily, and then tocall Howie\nKessler? Idon’t even know what we’re getting intowith Howie\ncoming home.\n“You think he’s coming? Idon’t. Idon’t believe afucking\nword hesays. Nice guy, I’msure. Maybe he’s still onthe\ndrugs,” Punch said.\nOnthedrive back Ithought about when weused toplay bas-\nketball together, whenever wecould fight ourway togetting a\ncourt foracouple ofhours. Weplayed handball, stickball, and\nsometimes bust upother games orplay dice instead. Wetrus-\ntedeach other only totheextent wehadto,meaning thatthere\nwasn’t awhole lotoftrust between thefiveofus.Weeach had\nfriends outside ourgang. Agang isanoddcreature andI’ve\nspent agood part ofmyadult lifethinking about what gang I\ncanbelong tonow, forshelter andprotection, forcamaraderie,\nforidentity. Itcan’t beduplicated—it shouldn’t beduplicated.\nWe got into a lot of trouble back then.\nIreturned home that evening andYuri hadalready prepared\ndinner.\n“I’m sorry Ididn’t callearlier. Itwas ahelluva day.” Iwas\nhoping he would let me clam up.\n35\n“Icantellyoudon’t want totalkabout it.Iwon’t bother you.\nExcept youshould have called totellmewhat wasgoing on.As\nfarasIknew youwould have been back intime forustocatch\nthe2pm movie attheQuad downtown. It’s8pm, you’re M.I.A.,\nandnow you’re clearly allmucked upindeep thought. Itold\nyou this Howie thing is a bad idea.”\nIdidn’t answer him, because Iknew where hewasgoing—if\nhe was angry enough with me.\nIthanked him fordinner, but hecontinued hisline of\nthinking.\n“Idon’t think Ihave toremind youwhat happens each time\nyou look back.”\nIdidn’t look upbecause Ididn’t want tofuel this quiet\noutburst.\n“You can’t control other people, Art.Maybe inyour jobyou\ncan, butyouspent 30years trying tochange people inyour life\nandlook where itgotyou—in anillegitimate gayrelationship\nand ostracized by your ex-wife and kids.”\nIputmyfork down tomake thepoint, silently, that Ididn’t\nwant tocontinue thisone-way conversation, butYuri continued\nit anyway.\n“Just leave italone, Art,leave thisonealone. Walk away now\nbefore you get involved beyond what you can control.”\nOnafewoccasions throughout mycareer inMajor League\nBaseball I’ve had the opportunity toweigh inonwhich\ncelebrity delivers aspeech totheowners, orwhich onethrows\noutaceremonial ballduring theplayoffs, orwhich one’s name\ngets buried orleaked inadrugs orprostitute scandal alongside\noneoftheplayers. I’ve often thought about Howie, since he\nwas theonly onewho loved baseball—and theNew York Yan-\nkees—as much asIdid. Inever sought him outand Inever\nreally thought about why.\nThere was thething with hisbrother Sammy, who gotinto\ntrouble betting over hishead andIplaced some numbers for\nhim. Henever paid upandIwent tothebosses. Idon’t think\nanyone thought Icould have done anything else. Theguywasa\ndegenerate andhewas lucky hegotinto trouble with meand\nmyguys rather than someone who would have thrown him a\nbeating, or worse.\n36\nThere were acouple ofother things that Howie andIkept\nsecret. Whereas sometimes secrets canbring twopeople closer\ntogether, Howie andIputupwalls between each other know-\ningwhat wewere keeping from theworld. It’seasier notto\nface your mirror image, Isuppose, when there aresome ugly\nthings youknow itwillreflect. Neither ofusactually graduated\nfrom high school. And then there’s thething about myinterest\ninmen. Howie may have shared it,too.Would itruin usnow?\nI’dhave togive thatsome thought, andIdon’t really care todo\nsonow, soI’mnotaltogether sure thismeeting upwith Howie\nthing is the best idea for anyone.\n37\nChapter 8Frank\n“Jesus, Mary andJoseph, these fucking kids, Dee, these fucking\nkids, it’s like they’re here to make my life a fucking mess.”\nIpressed 3andhoped thehold time fortheinsurance com-\npany wouldn’t beasfucking ridiculous asthelasttime oneof\nmykids totaled thecar. AsIwaited tospeak with ahuman,\nthey make mewait andlisten tothisfucking country music like\nI’msome backwoods hick who drove hispickup into aditch.\nMywife, Deirdre, tried tocalm medown butjustagitated the\nsituation even more soIwalked into another room tositon\nhold for god knows how much longer.\nThey finally sent a human.\n“Yeah, uh,wegotawrecked car,andmyfucking kid,isthere\nsome way youcanmake itsonone ofthem candrive mycar?\nSome technology? No,really, I’mserious. Like theopposite of\nLo-Jack orsomething. None ofthese fucking kids isonmyin-\nsurance policy and they keep driving and wrecking thecars.\nAnd you know—these are not cheap cars. This was the Lexus.”\nAfter about 45minutes ofnegotiating with these thieves I\nthink I got something to go my way.\nHewas racing at3am. Ialready hadtopaythecopthat ar-\nrived atthescene $10,000 tokeep hismouth shut about the\ndrugs inthecar, Ididn’t need anymore shitfrom theinsur-\nance company. Itrytokeep things above board these days.\nDario is22years old,hedoesn’t need tobetaking myfucking\ncaranymore, buthecan’t keep ajob,hecan’t kick thedrugs, I\ndon’t know what thefuck he’s going todo.Thekidcanbarely\nread forchrissake. Idon’t know what happened wrong with\nhim.\nNotthat theother three aremuch better. Petey’s 25andis\nslated togetcaught stealing from FedEx over atJFKAirport\n38\nwhere he’s working andpart ofacrime ring toliftpackages;\nVanessa’s 20years oldand hastwo kids from two different\nguys; Donna’s 19,fatashouse andhasrings through herface.\nIdon’t even know what thefuck shedoes formoney these\ndays, butnone ofthem arepaying rent because Deewon’t letit\nhappen. Not that she’s a softie, but rent is out of the question.\nIrealize Ihave toblame myself forsome ofthem fucking up.\nIwasn’t exactly around much forthem. Theconstruction busi-\nness hashad itsupsand downs, and ithasn’t been mysole\nsource ofincome over theyears; Ispent some time hanging\naround thewrong people doing some badthings. Today things\naremuch better, consistent, Ihave alotgoing formenow. But\nthe kids, they’re going to make me die an early death.\nDee says Iruined their sense ofresponsibility and self-re-\nspect. Idon’t know what thefuck she’s talking about. Iwork\nhard. Idon’t always play bytherules. Icame from atough\nchildhood, andnow Ihave aconstruction empire: Russo Works\nhandles 90% ofallthepublic school repairs inNew York City.\nMyfather beat theshitoutofme,thepriests beat theshitout\nofme,andthemob beat theshitoutofme.Idon’t gowrecking\nother people’s cars.\nIdofeelbadabout Petey. One ofmyguys gothimthejobat\ntheairport andIknew itwasn’t quite above board, butfigured\nhecouldn’t gethurt—quite frankly, Ithought hewastoostupid\ntopullanything off.Next thing Iknow thekid’s coming home\nwith wads ofcash andtheoccasional crate ofMP3 players or\nsome goddamned thing. He’s notsmart enough tokeep thisgo-\ning,Ikeep telling him. Ihope hedoesn’t gettoogreedy. Once\nthefeds start sniffing around here again, I’mdone. Toomuch\nin my past—I don’t want them connecting any dots.\nWith mykids allmessed upI’ve been thinking alotlately\nabout where Icame from andwhat Icould have done differ-\nently tohelp mykids grow upbetter. Idon’t articulate my\nthoughts well; Inever communicated well with anymembers of\nmyfamily. That shouldn’t beareason forthem tobesuch devi-\nants. What do I know, anyway.\n“Petey, would yougetupandfixthat goddamned ATV onthe\nfront lawn forchrissake. It’sbeen there forweeks. Can’t you\ngetthething going? I’mhaving people over tonight. Welook\n39\nlikeawhite trash neighborhood with shitoutonthelawn. Just\nfix the goddamned thing and get it the hell outta here.”\n“Get offmyback, Dad, willyourelax? You’re likeMussolini\nover here with theorders. What’s with youlately?” hesaid ef-\nfortlessly, without even looking up from his video game.\n“Aren’t you too old to be playing games on the TV anyway?”\nDeirdre walked inatthat moment andimmediately came to\nPetey’s defense.\n“He’s just relaxing, Frank, take it easy. He’s entitled.”\n“Entitled? Entitled? Getagoddamned jobandyou’ll been-\ntitled. You’re toooldforthisshit. Getthefuck outofhere be-\nfore I haul your ass out of the house altogether.”\n“Jezus! Frank, Take it easy! Leave him alone!”\nAllthewhile, Petey’s engrossed inhisTVgame anddoesn’t\neven bother toengage. This ishow heisallthetime, always\nhas been.\n“Look, I’mjusttrying totake back mygoddamned house that\nIwork myassofftokeep. It’sliketheprisoners arerunning\nthe jail here.”\n“Nice, Frank, they’re your kids andyou’re calling them pris-\noners. And you wonder why they behave like animals.”\nDeirdre was probably ontosomething there, butover 20\nyears andfour kids later, what thehellwasIgoing todoabout\nitnow? They’re alladults, I’mgetting old,she’s getting fat,and\nthey’re running usdown. AsIyelled tohertoorder enough\nfood for8people from D’Angelos, shewalked back inand\nlooked at me funny.\n“You goaround yelling ateverybody and humiliating your\nkids, andnow you’re buying everyone dinner onthenight you\nknow they’re all going to be out?”\nThough Iwanted totake credit forbuying everyone dinner, it\nwasn’t my intention.\n“No, tonight theguys arecoming byandwe’re watching a\ncouple of Howie’s movies.”\n“Again? Didn’t youjustgoover toBobby’s lastweek anddo\nthesame thing? What thehelldoyouguys do,jerkeach other\noff? Jesus, Frank, you’re pathetic.”\n“Oh yeah? Your assisgetting fatter bytheminute, Dee, so\nyou might want to do something about that.”\n“Fuck off. Have a nice night with your pathetic friends.”\n40\nIt’strue, meandtheguys watch Howie Kessler movies asof-\ntenaspossible. Wehave theme nights forhismovies. Weskip\nthefaggy musicals though, Idon’t know what thefuck hewas\nthinking then.\nHowie was mybest friend growing up.The lotofusran\naround together, butmeandHowie were thetightest. Welived\nright next door toeach other. Wehaditrough askids, poor as\nhell. Butwehadtherunoftheneighborhood foraslong asI\ncould remember. Askids weused tothrow rocks from the\nrooftop ofmybuilding toanyone wedidn’t know. Then when\nwegotolder, wepatrolled theblock with baseball bats, certify-\ningourterritory. Every block hadit,wewere nodifferent. But\nmeandHowie used tobeat theshitoutofanyone who tried to\nsteal our girls, our bike, or our territory.\nThen came ArtandPunch. Because wealllived onthesame\ncouple ofblocks, webecame ourown gang, ofsorts. Itworked\nout; weeach had ourown friends and backgrounds—and for\nthegang, weeach hadourown skills. Artwas great with the\nnumbers andhewasourmoney bagwhen weneeded it.Punch\nwasourplanner andschemed thebest ways togetgirls, stake\noutterritory, andripoffguys atthepool hall. They were also\nthe biggest, so we needed them.\nMowas theguyeverybody loved themost, butcouldn’t get\nclose toenough toknow what hewasgoing todonext. AsIre-\nmember it,most ofthereasons why weever gotinfights was\nbecause ofsomething Mosaid ordid.Heinstigated, hedisap-\npeared, heendeared everybody because hewassuch asmooth\ntalker. Moalways hadproblems with thedrugs, though. Howie\ntried desperately tohelp him with that, even when wewere\nyoung. Itkilled Howie that Mowassomessed upmuch ofthe\ntime. Ithink Iresented Mofortaking upsomuch ofHowie’s\ntime—time that heandIshould have been spending together\ndoing the things we loved to do when we were younger.\nWeallputsome money together each month from ourhust-\nlingatthepool halltorent aroom, ourclub room, from amean\nex-boxer who hadextra space inhiscandy store basement. We\ndideverything inthere and just having itwas oursource of\npride. One day, after playing cards forhours, Molooked up\nand said weneeded ajuke box. Hesaid that aclub room\nwasn’t really aclub room unless there was ajuke box. Howie\n41\nagreed andsaid wecould getgirls inthere ifwehave ajuke\nbox. Wecould barely scrape together enough money forthe\nrent, sothere was noway wewere buying ajuke box. Mean-\nwhile Joey Klein, theboxer and candy store owner, recently\ncomplained that hisrival candy store afewblocks away gota\nnew juke boxandthatitwasattracting hiscustomers andhurt-\ninghisbusiness. Moplanned forustohitthecandy store the\nnext night after closing. Howie stole Joey’s dolly, Punch, Art\nandIbroke into Mrs. Grossman’s candy store, stole thejuke\nbox, andthefiveofusrolled itonJoey’s dolly back toourclub\nroom. Joey never knew wehaditinthere since hewas nearly\ndeaf from taking too many punches.\nSoIwatch Howie’s movies now. I’vewatched hiscareer ever\nsince heleftBrooklyn. Wedidn’t hear from himforafewyears\nafter heleft, buthewrote afewletters when hewas inthe\nNavy andsent pictures ofLosAngeles once hemoved outthere\npermanently. Imeant togooutthere. Butsoon after weall\nsplit up,Igotmarried andstayed back here. Iknow that ifI\ncould seeHowie again, wewould betight asever, asifnotime\never went by, since 1963.\n* * * *\n“And wearegetting reports that thepostponement ofthe\nshooting forDonnie Birken’s new project which was being\nbilled asthenext Apocalypse Now isduetoaswitch inleading\nmen.

And now ontoother news: The\nnew reality television series—“\n“Dad. DAD. Yo, DAAAAAAA!!” Dario yelled from the couch.\n“What? Can’t yougetyour assupandspeak likeyou’re notin\nthe Grand fucking Canyon?” I said as I walked into the den.\n“Listen, Howie’s missing in L.A. It was just on TV.”\n“Go back, can you rewind it?” I said.\nIwatched thepiece onHowie andwondered what thehell\nwas going on. I hope he’s alright.\n“You should callhimup,Dad, after allthese years he’d prob-\nably like to hear from you.”\nIwent back tomynewspaper anddidn’t think about Howie\nuntil later that night. Mygoddamned kids give meagita andI\nhaven’t been sleeping forhours atatime. Soinbetween the\nanxiety ofkeeping mybusiness afloat asItrytoextract myself\nfrom certain relationships that only mean more trouble; and\nhow thefuck I’mgoing toafford mycarinsurance andDario’s\ndrug rehab, Isatupinbedandtried tothink about why welost\ntouch. There hadtobeareason. May bethefirst time inall\nthese years I’vestopped tothink about those days andwhy we\nnever kept intouch. Isuppose Ithought thatonedayback then\nI’dhear from him—but itnever came. Inever knew how toget\nintouch; ever since heleftfortheNavy Ijustwaited forhimto\nwrite tome.Sonow Ithought, nearly 50years later and no\ncontact from Howie, mybest friend growing up,why would he\njust leave us?And why didn’t therest ofusstay incloser\ntouch, either?\nIdoremember onething. Artused torunnumbers forsome\nguys, buthealso started taking bets onhisown sohecould\nearn more money. This guyknew sports andhow tobetbetter\nthan anyone Iever knew, including guys inthemob. Buthe\nhadtobecareful tokeep hisgame quiet sohisbread-and-but-\nterdidn’t find another kidtotake hisplace. Howie’s brother,\nSammy, owed Art’s guys alotofmoney andofcourse—like any\ndegenerate gambler—thought that hecould make itback by\nputting more money outthere. Arttook hisbet, reluctantly,\nandagainst myopinion. When thehorse losttherace orthe\nteam lostthegame, whichever itwas, Artneeded tocollect.\nWhen Sammy didn’t pay, Artwent toHowie. Howie told Art\n43\nthat heshouldn’t have taken thebet.Sowhere does thisleave\nArt? With two pissed off bosses about to put the screws on.\nTobehonest, Idon’t know what Iwould have done ifIhad\nbeen inArt’s shoes. Sammy wasn’t aparticularly likable guy\nandwassuch aloser that hisfiancée stood himupatCity Hall.\nArtwent tothebosses andexplained that hetook Sammy’s bet\nontheside. Artplayed itmore shifty than Ihadeven expected\nhimto,andportrayed itinsuch away that itwastheonly side\nbethetook even though itwasn’t. Howie couldn’t help butfeel\nthat Art sold Sammy out, for his own self-preservation.\nArt and Howie obviously never got over that one.\nIthought alotabout those days forthenext fewnights. I\ncan’t honestly saywereally ever helped each other outallthat\nmuch. Ourgroup started tosplinter before weeven gotoutof\nhigh school. Inever graduated andwent right towork formy\nuncle inbuilding thepavilion andother projects related tothe\n1964/ 65World’s Fair inQueens, and only came around the\nclub room occasionally. Wedidshoot pool often, butonce I\nstarted working, Ihadmoney coming inanddidn’t need allthe\npool hustling and fights that ensued.\nThat wasn’t it,andI’msure there were more fissures over\nthose years than Icare toremember. Ididlove Howie, though.\nHealways looked outforme,andIdidn’t care that hestarted\nhanging around with adifferent bunch ofguys later on.Things\nhave always got to change a little, or else you go a little crazy.\nInever went tothereunions because half theguys Ihung\naround with didn’t graduate andprobably aren’t even onthe\nalumni mailing lists. Once upon atime Iwould have liked to\nhear about what some oftheguys were doing, butnow we’re\njustold. It’sbeen toolong. Ijustdon’t care; Ihave myown\ntroubles. I’d still love to see Howie.\n44\nChapter 9Mo\n“Baby youstilldoitforme.Youarestillthegreatest baby any-\nonecould have inthesack,” Isaid toSheila, myex-wife, asshe\nturned over inthebedandlitacigarette, notbothering tocov-\ner her body with the sheet.

I’mflush thisweek. Good timing for\nyou.”\n“You’re notintrouble again, right? Imean, what areyou\ntalking about, flush?” Sheila knew meand mybusiness well.\nShe knew who I did business with. It’s partly why she left me.\n“I’m fine, everything’s good.

Forchrissake, Mo,I’llleave youthemoney. Jesus, you\nknow, you’re going to give me a heart attack.”\nThat was Sheila’s favorite line, foryears. Then shehad a\nheart attack 8years ago. She still says it,asifnothing\nhappened, but it’s just not funny anymore.\n“Ineed more,” Isaid, hoping she would understand the\nsubtext.\n45\n“Hon, Itold youIdon’t have time—Loehmann’s closes at6\ntonight and—oh, wait, you need more what, money?”\n“Jimmy’s guys are coming by tomorrow night.”\n“What didyoudo?Areyoustealing from them? You stupid\nfool, are you stealing from Jimmy Butler?”\n“No, Iborrowed andthisislikeamargin call. Richie under-\nstands that.”\n“You fucking idiot. Iknow what afucking margin callis,Mo.\nHow much? No,forget it,Idon’t want toknow. Doyouwant\nme to call Richie?”\nIdidn’t want hertocallRichie. Ihoped shehadaccess tothe\nmoney herself. I knew she didn’t, but hoped anyway.\n“Imay justgetoutoftown forawhile,” Isaid, halfunder my\nbreath.\n“You dumb fuck, they’ll find you. Doyouwant them toblow\nupyour goddamned boat again? Why doyoudothis? Why can’t\nyou just manage the club and be done with it?”\n“Because youandRichie wouldn’t have your coke ifallIdid\nwasmanage theclub, that’s why, Sheila, sodon’t give methat\nshit about quitting the business. I’m doing fine.”\nWedidourbusiness andSheila wrote meacheck tocash for\n$9,999. Ididn’t tellherthat itwas just afraction ofwhat I\nowed, but I was grateful for it anyway.\nIco-own ahealth club inSheepshead Bay. Nearly allmycus-\ntomers arealso mycoke customers, soitworks out. Iknow a\nlotofpeople, andmore people know me. Things don’t always\ngoassmooth asthey should. People don’t pay. Thegood thing\nisthat thecontract onthehealth club membership agreement\nthey unwittingly sign requires hefty up-front fees, their credit\ncard numbers, and consent togarnish when appropriate. So\nwhen someone doesn’t payfortheir package and they don’t\nshow uponthetreadmill, wecharge oneormore oftheir cred-\nitcards.

Back inthedayIhandled a\nlotmore money andenjoyed thepackages justasmuch asmy\nclientele. Igotinover myhead afewtimes. There were some\nmisunderstandings. Ididn’t take thebusiness asseriously asI\nshould have. I lost everything to some very bad guys.\nI’vedone mytime. Two 18-month stints inthecan, butthat\nwaslong ago. Coming outwasthehardest part. Noonetrusts\nyouwhen you’ve been inprison. Youhave toprove yourself all\nover again. Iwasinmyearly 50’s when Iwasconvicted forthe\nfirst time. It’snoteasy inthere. Putting thebusiness andmy\nlifeback together after thesecond time, ayear later, was the\nhardest thing I’ve ever done.\nIdon’t worry much about getting caught anylonger. Iplay a\nmuch cleaner game now than Ididyears ago. Itwasinevitable\nback then, Iwas sloppy andsomeone snitched. Ishould have\nseen it coming.\nI’monly introuble now because Ispread things outalittle\ntoothin and Ijust have tostep upcollections. Noskimming\nanymore. Iknow what I’mdoing. I’m66years old,forchris-\nsake. I’minthebest shape ofmylife,Ifuck likecrazy, Igotno\nother attachments and the money’s good.\nBrooklyn, forme,isthecenter oftheworld. Itallbegins here\nanditallends here. Idon’t need anything else. Ihave myown\nChinatown, right upon65th Street and8thAvenue. Ihave the\nbeach, theboardwalk, therides, thegirls inshort skirts on\nConey Island. Igotfishing here inSheepshead BayandIlive\nonmyboat. IgotRussian nightclubs with thebest vodka and\nhookers onEarth inBrighton Beach. Igot golf inDyker\nHeights. Igotdiscount shopping onFulton Street. Igotwhat\nlittle family isleftwho stilltalktomeinBoro Park. Idon’t ever\nneed to leave this place—not for nothing.\nIdecided togooutandhave adrink andfigure outwhat the\nfuck Iwas going todoabout therest ofthe$51,000 Ineeded\ntocome upwith bytomorrow. Iwent down toBenny’s place\n47\nandsatdown atthefarendofthebar, where Icould seeany-\none coming in the door, and ordered a whiskey.\nBenny poured it and leaned into me over the bar.\n“You know Jimmy’s guys came looking for you.”\n“When?” Iwasn’t worried, since mylast conversation we\nagreed tomorrow night I’dbring thedough over tohisplace in\nBay Ridge.\n“Earlier today,” Benny whispered, looking around asifthere\nwere anyone inthebaratthat time ofday who would be\nlistening.\n“They justcome intomake themselves known, they’re not\ngoing to do anything to me. I have until tomorrow, anyway.”\n“Awright, ifyousayso,”hesaid ashedrew back, shaking his\nhead. Still with hisarm onthebar, heturned away andlooked\nupatthetelevision. “Igotta getoneofthose flat-screens in\nhere. This thing is a piece of shit.”\nIlooked upattheTVandwatched forafewmoments. Itwas\none ofthose celebrity gossip programs. Oddly engrossing,\nBenny andIsatsilently watching theshow andnotasoul was\ninthebar. There was ashort segment onmyold,oldfriend,\nHowie Kessler.\n“Hey Benny, turn it up, there’s Howie.”\n“And wearegetting reports that thepostponement ofthe\nshooting forDonnie Birken’s new project which was being\nbilled asthenext Apocalypse Now isduetoaswitch inleading\nmen. Mysources aretelling methat Howard Kessler isno\nlonger onthisfilmandwewillreport back assoon asmore in-\nformation becomes available onthisdeveloping story. This is\nRena White in Hollywood. Michelle, back to you.”\n“Thank youRena. Here atthestudio oursources aretelling\nusthatHoward Kessler hasn’t been seen around town insever-\nalweeks, and calls tohismanager and agent, Alan Shiner,\nwent unreturned. Darren, what doyouthink ofthis? Where is\nHoward Kessler? And why isn’t heshooting what could behis\nnext big blockbuster with Donnie Birken?”\n“Well, Michelle, Idon’t think itlooks good forHoward tore-\nmain absent during thisspeculation. Idon’t know why histeam\nhasn’t come outwith astatement about thefilmorhiswhere-\nabouts. Frankly, this isalllooking quite suspicious. Wewill\n48\ncontinue tofollow thisstory. And now ontoother news: The\nnew reality television series—“\n“I can turn this shit off now, right?” Benny said.\n“Yeah, Jesus, what’s Howie uptothese days. Didyouseethe\nlast thing he was in, last summer?”\n“That war movie? Yeah, that was good. He’s good inthose\nmovies. Wonder why he never comes back here.”\nIhadn’t thought about Howie inages. It’sbeen solong since\nthelast time hecame outhere. Weboth gotinto abitof\ntrouble. Igotpeople who stillaren’t talking tomebecause of\ntheshitwestirred up.Ihadafriend whose horse wasrunning\natBelmont about 25years agoand Howie and Igotalittle\nmixed upinfixing acouple ofraces. Wecleaned up,butafew\noftheother players around town gotwind ofitandmade some\nthreats. Before weknew it,there was agrand jury investiga-\ntion, Howie’s biglawyers showed uphere andmade itallgo\naway. Butnotwithout themedia andlocal gangsters allwant-\ning a piece of the action.\n“Why don’t youcallHowie and getthemoney from him?”\nBenny asked.\n“You out of your fucking mind?”\n“You know he’s got it.”\n“First off,Iwouldn’t know how inamillion years togetin\ntouch with theguy. Hello, Hollywood? Yes, I’mlooking formy\nfriend Howie Kessler, I’mjustaloser from Brooklyn soplease\npatch me through. Sure, that’ll work.”\n“Hey, you asked.”\n“No, Benny, Ididn’t fucking ask. Youalways dothat. Youof-\nfer advice when no one asks for it.”\n“Hey, I’mabartender, whaddya want from me? Italk itup\naround here, you cranky bastard.”\n“Just get me another drink.”\nItwasridiculous, andnever inamillion years would Iever do\nthat. Despite thejoking with Benny, Icouldn’t help butthink\nabout Howie—not only thegood times we’ve had, butthat he\ncould really help meoutnow. Iwondered ifhewould, even ifI\ndid know how to get in touch with him.\nNah, Imean, theguy had severed relationships with just\nabout everyone here. NooneIknow hasspoken tohimsince\nthelasttime washere inNew York. Andeven then, hekept his\n49\nexposure totheoldgang limited—partly, Iimagine, because\nwehadn’t spoken tooneanother inages. We’ve gotnothing in\ncommon anymore. And I’mnoteven supposed tobeinthe\nsame room as Frankie, a condition of the plea agreement.\nMyfirst realjoboutofhigh school wasasacourt reporter. I\nhadtons ofassignments anddidthem well enough toearn a\nliving once mymother kicked meoutoftheapartment. Itried\ntoprove toagirlIwas with—more accurately, toherpar-\nents—that Iwasn’t thelowlife hustler they thought Iwas—that\nIcould keep astraight job.After afewmonths webroke up.\nButIkept thejob,because Isoon realized that theinformation\nIhad unfettered access towas valuable tocertain people. I\nhave anear photographic memory, which helps. Butbetween\nthepeople Iknew from Brooklyn and theinformation Itran-\nscribed, Iwas selling information from depositions and testi-\nmonies tothemob forquite abitofmoney. Iwasable tokeep\nthisupforyears, andnever gotcaught. What stopped mewas\nwhen aguybeing deposed inagrand jury investigation was\nFrank Russo, myFrankie. Theprosecutor must have seen our\nfaces when they brought Frankie into theroom. Ihadn’t seen\nmuch ofFrank inyears. Hestopped hanging around ourclub\nroom shortly after wegraduated since hewas working forhis\nuncle. Butapparently hisuncle hadhimdoing more than hoist-\ningbricks. Though Inever gotcaught selling myinformation, I\nthought that theworld wastoosmall andthat wasmywarning\ntostop being greedy. Inever gotoutfrom under thetiestothe\nmob, though, since these guys wouldn’t take noforananswer\nonce Ileftthecourt reporting job.Either way, meandFrankie\ncan’t be seen together.\nIt’sbeen along time; we’ve allbeen through alot.And we\nweren’t exactly tight asarope consistently asteenagers. We\nhadourrouts with each other andourown friends. Icouldn’t\nstand how Howie stood upfortwo ofthedumbest guys we\nknew, Eddie “Slip” and Louis “Bean.” IfIcould remember\nwhatever dumb-fuck story itwas that they earned those nick-\nnames Iwould love totellit.They were always getting into\ntrouble because they were just sostupid—and Howie would\nrisk alottodefend them. Hisassociation with those guys al-\nmost landed him injail—shortly after oursenior year inhigh\nschool, SlipandBean gotjobs asdrivers foranew Oldsmobile\n50\ncardealership that opened upon86th Street inBensonhurst.\nNot twomonths into thejobdidthey trytosteal acar. You\ndon’t understand—no onestole cars back then. Itwasunheard\nof.Butthese twoidiots somehow thought they would getaway\nwith it.And where didthey gowith their brand-new, shiny\nOldsmobile? Howie’s mother’s house.\nWegotsickofitandjuststopped hanging around Howie be-\ncause of this and other dead-end reasons.\nSoasIwas saying, you just don’t resurrect ties after 50\nyears. You just can’t do it.\n51\nChapter 10Howard: The Road Home\nHoward leftHollywood. With noceremonious departure party,\nnowarm embraces, hegotontheroad atabout 6:30am after a\nshort runonthebeach, aquick shower, andalastlook around\nhishouse. Heleftthekeys onthegranite counter, picked up\ntwoduffel bags, putonhisRay-Bans, andstepped outthefront\ndoor.\nLong distance isnotsomething Howard isused todriving. In\nfact, herarely even drives himself anymore, accompanied by\nanentourage usually composed ofanycombination ofpublicist,\nagent, manager, andhangers-on wherever hegoes. Nosimple\nventures toadiner foraquick bite; nostops atthegrocery\nstore. Howard’s public lifehasbeen choreographed, planned,\nandprotected. Theunderside ofthat public life,however, has\nbeen aconstant battle tomaintain hisown independence—the\nself-dependence that hecultivated asfarback asearly child-\nhood, inatenement fullofolder relatives with little tempera-\nment tomind atroublesome kid. Howard’s mischief asakid\nseeped into adolescent and adult lifeand took theform of\nbooze, drugs, gambling, andhookers—since hecouldn’t main-\ntain asolid relationship with awoman foranyfixed period of\ntime.\nOver theyears heworked hard toalienate hisbrother,\nSammy, andhissister, Judith. Sammy moved outtoL.A. tobe\nwith Howie andescape hisgambling debts ontheeast coast,\nbutsoon lifecaught upwith him. Howie couldn’t gethimajob\nthat hecould keep, andhecouldn’t escape hisgambling addic-\ntion. Compounded with Howie’s own substance addictions,\nSammy’s lifewasathread away from total self-destruction and\nnearly brought Howie’s down with him. Hereturned toNew\nYork inthelate1980s andhadbeen living intheEast Village\n52\nwith aheroin-addicted performance artist who later painted\nherself redandthrew herself infront ofabusonFirst Avenue.\nJudith moved toIsrael with herhusband in1979. Howard vis-\nited once, forJudith’s kid’s batmitzvah in1988. Hefelt\nhumbled byJudith’s abundance offaith inherandherfamily’s\nlifeandthehardships they endured asKibbutzim inacountry\nrattled with mortar. Hewasrelieved toreturn toL.A., slightly\njealous ofhissister’s lifeinaway that hecouldn’t articulate.\nThey didn’t speak often, they probably justdon’t have much to\nsay to one another.\nRarely alone, Howard never really came face toface theugly\nfacts ofhislife.Exiling himself toacarandalonely road for\nmore than 3,000 miles was areckoning with himself that he\nhadn’t faced since hewas inrehab inthe1980s—and even\nthen henever truly thought about what made him who heis\nandwhy. Hequestioned why hewas leaving. Hequestioned\nwhat hewas searching for.Hequestioned ifgoing back to\nBrooklyn and finding hisoldfriends was inhisbest interest.\nMost meaningful ofallwashisquestion ofwhat hethought he\ncould getoutofseeing guys heknew asakid,when they knew\nnothing about one another today.\nWait, what the hell was he doing?\nBefore heknew it,hewas inKansas City anditwas time to\nstop and reconsider thewhole trip, since hewas spending\nmore time inthecarreconsidering thechoices he’s made than\nlooking forward toseeing thegang. Heremembered amovie\nhewas inwhere themafia setupshop inKansas City inthe\n1940’s andthen continued tomove west toLasVegas. There\nwasnoshooting inKansas City itself, though, soHoward spent\nacouple ofhours that evening walking around thedowntown\nareas making mental notes ofhow different thesets andthe\nlocation shooting which was in Vancouver, Canada.\nHegotback ontheroad andcalled Punch letting himknow\nhe’d beathishouse inacouple ofdays, maybe less. Punch\nsounded surprised orcaught off-guard. Howard sets anobject-\niveand doesn’t letanything deter him from reaching itas\nquickly aspossible, regardless ofwho gets knocked down en\nroute. Hisdecisions aremade promptly and assertively. This\none, though, hestarted toquestion, andhewas disconcerted\nthat hewas questioning hisown decision. Hewanted toget\n53\nback tothestate ofmind hewas inwhen hedecided totrack\ndown theguys andcome back—it wasasettling feeling. Sitting\ninabusy steakhouse atatable alone inthecorner was nota\nsettling feeling, knowing that hisobjectives fortrip weren’t\nclear enough towarrant theplan hesetforaction. Maybe Alan\nwas right, hejust needed amonth ortwoinMaui orMonte\nCarlo. Now he’s inKansas City enroute toBrooklyn viasub-\nurban New Jersey to see guys he doesn’t even know, or like.\nHestarted tothink about Punch, Art,even Frankie andMo.\nThere had tobereasons why hehadn’t kept incloser\ntouch—he justhadtorecall why. Hecouldn’t even remember\nthelasttime they were alltogether inthesame room. Infact,\nwhen hedid, itwas anawful riftthat began what may have\nbeen thesplit-up ofthegroup that hehad initially forgotten\nabout. Hecouldn’t even remember what theincident was to\nstart it,other than heandacouple ofother friends hadtried to\ngain access toArt’s club room—a room attheback ofacandy\nstore that heandsome others rented tohang outin.When Art\ngotwind ofit,hechased down Howie’s friends andwith the\nhelp ofFrankie andsome other grunts, shaved theintruders’\nheads. Though they didn’t touch Howie, hewas mortified. He\nthought Artwashisfriend andhecould justgohang outinthe\nclub room with hisown guys. In1957, shaving ateenage boy’s\nhead was theultimate humiliation. They would spend hours\nslicking their hair into perfect greaser styles.\nHoward gotinthecarearly thenext morning. Heknew\ndefinitively that returning toLos Angeles was notgoing to\nprovide himwith theresolve hesought. Notknowing where he\nwas headed—or why—as hesatinthecold seat, hewatched\nthesteam ofthehotcoffee sitting onthedashboard cloud upa\nlittle oval onthewindow. Though hewasn’t rushed tomake a\ndecision, heneeded more clarity soheturned offthemotor\nandthought about thereasons why hewassointent onleaving\nLos Angeles:\nIhave nocareer anylonger because Ihave little desire to\nact, not to mention the paucity of significant roles for me.\nIhave noattachments topeople—women—and can’t seem to\nforge any. Except Alan, myfriends inL.A. arenotreliable,\nlifelong, trusted friends the way he thinks friends should be.\n54\nIreally dohate alotabout L.A. It’sdesperate andshallow\nand reeks of anxiety and despair.\nWithout close connections andarealdesire tocontinue living\nthere, Howard’s feelings were atbest, apathetic. Hethought\nthat lifeistooshort andchallenge, passion, learning andnew\nexperiences ought to lie ahead—not repetitious tedium.\nBut none ofthis was good enough tojustify returning to\nBrooklyn. Many years ago hewas resolute incutting many\nclose ties, since he—and Alan—knew that destruction only\nbreeds destruction. Though hewas uncertain ofwhat lie\nahead, hewas resolute that heneeded tomake achange. He\nwouldn’t getroles, even ifhewanted them. Hewouldn’t form\nmeaningful attachments with women unless hechanged hisun-\nderlying desire todoso.Hewouldn’t hate L.A. somuch ifhe\nwasn’t sodesperate, shallow, andfullofanxiety anddespair.\nSowith that, Howard’s fundamental pursuit ofchange wasthe\nreason forheading toBrooklyn, nottoreturn there forsenti-\nmentality which—so many years later—would notprovide en-\nduring satisfaction.\nHeturned onthecaragain, pulled outofthehotel lotinKan-\nsas City, and continued to drive east.\nThe next night hestopped thecarwas inIndianapolis.\nHoward was tired andthere was nothing todointhecity. It\nwas totally barren and thehotel desk didn’t even recognize\nhim. Howard isn’t somuch anegotistical movie staraskeen on\nhissurroundings: Ifpeople don’t recognize who heis,they are\nmost likely devoid ofanyculture, inhismind. Allthebetter, he\ncould usetherestandquietude. Hepulled thecurtains open in\nhishotel room overlooking Union Station andthemain plaza in\nthecity. Itwas litupnicely. Because Indianapolis anditssur-\nrounding area aresoflat, theclear night enabled Howard to\nseethelines ofsuburban light formiles. Hepulled upthedesk\nchair tothewindow, satback andperched hisfeet uponthe\nsill. What the fuck am I doing in Indianapolis? he thought.\nFinally, after months ofstruggling with where hewas inhis\ncareer andhislife,Howard finally took afewmoments tothink\nabout where hehad decided togo.Brooklyn. The dead-end,\ndeath-spiral, meatball-mentality, Brooklyn. From themoment\nhecould pinpoint hisself-awareness andpresence inBrooklyn,\nHoward bristled and couldn’t wait togetoutofthere. The\n55\nprojects, thestupid, provincial mindset, thefake attitude, the\nethnocentrism, thexenophobia, themelting pot,thesmells, the\npizza, the ElTrain, the beach. Itwas home; hehated\neverything about himself that was Brooklyn. Buthewouldn’t\nhave hiscareer ifitweren’t fortheBrooklyn inhim—nearly\nevery successful roleheplayed wasbased upon acharacter he\ncould have known inBrooklyn. Thewise-guy, thegangster, the\npoor immigrant, theRussian mobster, theworking-class aspir-\nant, thethug, thevictim, thekiller, thelover, thechef. He\ncouldn’t have done them without Brooklyn; andHollywood and\nthe world loved him for it.\nHewondered who hewould seewhen hewas back. He\nwondered ifthey could find Frankie andMo, andwhether he\neven wanted tosee those guys—if they were even alive.\nHoward was aware that heturned hisback onthegang once\nheleftforL.A. years earlier. Herealized when hewas inthe\nNavy that there was nothing really tying thegroup together.\nHe could be his own person without them.\nOne question hepondered was whether any feelings they\nmay have hadofbetrayal would linger ifhecame back. How\ndoes hejustify turning hisback onthem after allthey hadbeen\nthrough? Asatight group, they were about 16years oldatthe\ntime, their club room was their home base and Artrented it\nfrom theowner ofthecandy store owner, aformer boxer, Joey\nKlein. Theguys pooled some money togive toArtsothey could\nallcallittheir own, though Artmanaged theplace andthere-\nlationship with thelandlord—even bythetime hewas 14,Art\nwas doing deals. The landlord was amiddleweight champion\ncontender, butlosthishearing after getting toobanged upand\nretired. Hewasamonster, though. Income from acandy store\ninthose days wasn’t enough tosupport adrunken ex-boxer and\nafamily with three kids. Sohisyoung wife—had tobenoolder\nthan 21—worked numerous jobs tokeep thefamily afloat. Joey\nused tobeat herup,butnoonehadevidence enough toreally\ndoanything about it.One late night, theguys were intheir\nclub room playing cards when they heard Joey beating onhis\nwife upstairs. Without hesitation ordiscussion, thefivebusted\nopen thedoor and ranupthestairs. They beat this former\nchamp with thekitchen chairs andthrew himoutthesecond-\nfloor window onto thefireescape. They then packed upthe\n56\nfamily’s things andputthem onabusback tothewife’s fam-\nily’s home inAllentown, Pennsylvania. This wasoneofthefew\ntimes thefiveagreed andneeded nonegotiations orcomprom-\nisestoaccomplish something. This wasalso oneofmany pain-\nful memories—there was nothing bittersweet about it.\nButitstillhung inHoward’s mind that hisleaving without\nany contact with the group wouldn’t go over well.\nFrankie idolized Howard before hewasanactor. Frankie fol-\nlowed Howard around when they were ingrade-school togeth-\ner.They were inseparable. Frankie always looked out for\nHoward—more sowhen they were inthegang together be-\ncause Frankie feltresponsible forHoward. Henever picked a\nfight. Henever went after hisgirl. Henever challenged Howie.\nBecause ofthat, Howard wasloyal toFrankie. Butonce heleft,\nhe was gone.\nHowie figured Frankie wasstillinBrooklyn. Hegotupfrom\nhischair inthehotel andcalled theoperator tohelp himfind\nthe Frank Russo he grew up with.\nMinutes later, thephone rang inHoward’s hotel room andhe\nhesitated topick itup—what would hesaytoFrank, hehadn’t\neven thought about it.\nIt was the operator. There are 17 Frank Russos in Brooklyn.\nHoward’s first instinct wastocallAlan, who would beable to\narrange ananswer orsolution toanyofHoward’s questions\nover thepast 20years. Alan would have aminion dothere-\nsearch ormake thecalls. Buthewasonhisown now andhad\nto make a decision.\nHehadthehotel operator send him the17phone numbers\nandaddresses oftheFrank Russos inBrooklyn. One ofthem\nwould betheguy. Hewould callwhen hecould gethishead to-\ngether onwhat hewould say. Maybe hewould wait until he\nsawPunch, though hedidn’t think Punch would have anyopin-\niononitoneway ortheother. OrArt,who never really liked\nFrank, though.\nPlanning thenext few days, weeks and months ofhislife\ncame down tositting inthehotel room inIndianapolis. Howard\nneeded anew project tocallhisown—shape it,develop it,and\nseeittofruition. Heknew hecould take onsomething spectac-\nularly consuming since hehadlittle else going oninhislife.\nTaking onthegang would bethenext project. Howard was\n57\ngoing towrite aplay. Hecouldn’t possibly re-engage with them\nwithout areason, andhedidn’t have anyother reason than to\nusethestories andperspectives toincorporate intoaplay. He\nwould reinvent himself, again, with apiece hecould truly call\nhis own. It’s about time.\nHeleftIndianapolis andthought that there could benothing\never intheworld that would make him goback there again.\nDriving east andonthelastlegofhisjourney, Howard decided\nthat hewould wait tocallFrank from Punch’s place andthat\nway hewould have better grounding togettheoldgang back\ntogether. Hewas stilluncertain about what toexpect; though\nhis decision to return was final and he didn’t waver.\nHoward could remember thelasttime hedrove uptheNew\nJersey Turnpike. Itwas 1962 andheandthegang packed in\nPunch’s girlfriend’s cartoAtlantic City. Itseemed likeaworld\naway; and formany inthecar, itwas thefirst time outof\nBrooklyn, including Howard. He,Frank andPunch inthefront\nseat, their girlfriends intheback seat. They went fishing onthe\nsteel pier, compared theboardwalk toConey Island’s and\nplayed some games atthecasino. They were young andthough\nthey hadcleaned upatthepool hallthenight before andfelt\nloaded with cash, itwasn’t enough togetthem alldinner and\nentertainment likethey hadplanned. They spent onenight at\ntheClaridge andditched at5am thenext morning without pay-\ningfortheroom. Itwasanice memory—but that’s allitwas, a\nmemory, and Howard refused to be tethered to nostalgia.\nInafew short moments hewould bepulling into Punch’s\ndriveway. Nearly 50years hadpassed since these once-close\nfriends had even talked in person.\n58\nChapter 11Howard and Punch\nCrunchy leaves. I’vebeen dying tostep oncrunchy leaves ever\nsince IlostmylegandIcan’t walk. Being acitykid,wedidn’t\nhave many crunchy leaves intheautumn, sowhenever Ihadan\nautumn tripoutside thecityIloved tostep oncrunchy leaves.\nIt’soneofthethings Icherish being outhere inJersey. Adele\nand Iwere sitting ontheside porch, partially enclosed with\nscreens andglass, andwatched theneighbor’s kids play ball\nnext door. Apparently Howard isduehere anyminute. Adele\nwas furious with mebecause Ididn’t tellheruntil late last\nnight that hewas supposed tobecoming. Istilldon’t believe\nwe’ll seehim. She’s been fussing alldaywith thehouse, shop-\nping, the guest room.\n“Ihave tofixthetowels intheguest bath upstairs andturn\nthe roast, you need anything?” she asked.\n“First, Adele, wedon’t even know he’s staying. Orcoming for\nthat matter. You’re going crazy with this. Relax. No,Idon’t\nneed anything. Just sitdown andenjoy theweather while we\ncan still sit outdoors.”\nAnyopportunity Ihad, Iliked tobeoutside. Working inanof-\nficefor40years andliving inatenement before then hasdriv-\nen me to hate being inside when I don’t need to be.\n“And? And what ifhedoes come? And what ifhedoes stay?\nWhat, arewegoing toputhim onthecouch? Ormake him\nshare ourbathroom? Sometimes, Karol, youjustdon’t have any\nsense.”\nSoIlethergoonwith herbusiness. Itcan’t hurt anybody.\nShe stepped inside and I heard pots clanging.\nIspied alarge, black, SUV with blacked-out windows driving\nslowly upthestreet, andthen afewmoments later back down\nthe street. Then up again. For the love of god, it’s Howie.\n59\nIwould give anything tostand upright now andwalk across\nthe lawn. I would give anything.\nIfeelsoold,tired, andworn down. Like awhole lifehasrun\nmeover anddragged meunder thewheels. Andhere Iam,un-\nable tomove andforthefirst time indecades, Iwant torun.\nTears started running down myface asIsaw Howie stop the\ntruck andgetout,looking upatmyhouse. Itwasthesame look\nhehadwhen hegotoutofthecarwhen weallmade ahigh\nschool trip to Atlantic City: awe, mixed with skepticism.\n“Howie,” Itried tocallout, butmyvoice cracked, “Howie,”\nnot much better. “Adele, get the door, Howie’s here, ADELE!”\nShecomes running from thekitchen holding aragandsees\nthrough thefront window Howie standing there looking atthe\nhouse and she runs back into the kitchen.\n“Adele, where thehell areyou going? Would you getthe\ndoor?”\n“Igotta putonsome coffee and putthecake out! Jesus,\nKarol, why didn’t you tell me he’d be here now!”\nIfumbled with thefolded upnewspaper inmychair and\nrolled through thedining room tothefront door. AsIopened\nit, Howie was stepping up the walkway, holding a duffel bag.\n“Idon’t fucking believe it!”hesaid asheopened thescreen\ndoor andstepped inside. Either ArttoldhimIwasinachair or\nhe’s just remarkably cool inhisreaction, because hedidn’t\nblink. Heleaned down andweembraced, Icouldn’t getahold\nof myself.\n“Punch, baby, look atyou, fullhead ofhair, you bastard!\nWhat is it, 30 years? More?”\n“Howie,” Ibumbled, “It’s justsogreat toseeyou. Ican’t get\nover it.Ireally didn’t think you’d come. Imean, youknow, I\njust didn’t really expect it.”\n“Hey, I said I’d be here, and I’m here, aren’t I?”\nBythistime, nearly every neighbor ontheblock waspeering\nouttocatch aglimpse ofHoward Kessler, inKarol andAdele\nPlotkin’s foyer. Irealized that Adele couldn’t help butcallher\nfriends andneighbors—this wasthemost exciting thing tohap-\npentohersince thetwograndkids were born. Shecame hust-\nlingoutofthekitchen with ahuge trayfullofpastries, cookies,\nandthesilver serving setfrom ourwedding thathadbeen used\nmaybe twice before.\n60\n“IsthisAdele? Jesus, youlook justlikeIremember youwhen\nyouwere 17!” Howard said, kindly. Iknew that theactor was\ncoming out now.\n“Oh, Howie, youtoo!It’ssonice ofyoutocome back andsee\nus! What took you so long?” she said.\nThere’s aloaded question, Ithought. Without missing abeat,\nHowie answered. “Ibeen busy butIhaven’t stopped thinking\nabout you guys.”\nTerrible answer. Icouldn’t think ofamore insincere way to\ningratiate himself tohishostess. Itwent right over Adele’s\nhead, though, since she’s pretty much desensitized tocom-\nments that require arebuttal. She smiled and setdown the\ntray with the mountain of cholesterol and sugar.\n“I’llletyouboys catch up,” Adele said, andraninto thekit-\nchen, no doubt to get on the phone.\nIdidn’t even know what tosaytotheguy. Helooked sofa-\nmiliar, butnotbecause Iknew him. Heleaned over andtook\nmyhand, andputhishead down. Ididn’t know ifhewaspray-\ning or would start weeping.\n“Punch, you don’t know what this means tome, after all\nthese years, seeing you. I’ve missed so much,” he said.\nTobehonest, Iwasn’t altogether sure Iwanted tobesitting\nhere dealing with thisright now. Iimmediately sensed anul-\nterior motive. Recognizing, however, thatIamslightly neurotic\nandthat sometimes people donotalways have itoutforme,I\ngave this ashot. And notentirely unfazed bytheflood of\nmemories, itcould begood formetoremember thegood times\ninstead offocusing ontheshitthat Ihave tohandle now with\nthe disease and my lopped-off leg.\n“Remember when weused torunaround theold,deserted\nCoast Guard station inManhattan Beach?” Iasked, hoping to\nstart up an easy chat about the dumb things we used to do.\n“Yeah, andthat time itwasn’t deserted andthefederal Mar-\nshalls chased usintrucks outofthere?” heanswered back. I\nwasn’t sure ifhewasbeing polite, butitwasaremarkable time\nto remember.\nAfter thewar, theCoast Guard closed thestation atthetipof\nManhattan Beach. Though itseemed excluded, wecutthe\nfence andtore theplace upandstole asmuch stuff aswecould\ngetourhands on.Wewere about 13or14years oldatthetime\n61\nsoplaying cops and robbers onareal base using fireextin-\nguishers asguns was ablast. Itwas also federal trespassing\nandvandalism, sowhen theMarshalls came tohunt usdown\nafter they spied agiant hole cutinthefence; weused thefire\nextinguishers on them and ran like hell.\nPost-war Brooklyn was teeming with experiences forun-\ntethered kids.\nWetalked foralong while about theolddays; andthecon-\nversation kept shifting back toHoward. Nosurprise, Iguess,\nsince my life isn’t all that glamorous.\nItwasgetting lateandAdele poked herhead inandasked if\nweneeded anything. Isaid no,andHowie stood up.Iexpected\nhimtobidgoodbye, andbedone with us.Ihave acardiologist\nappointment inthemorning, Josh iscoming byintheafternoon\nformore PT,andLaw &Order isonat8pm with anew epis-\node. Idon’t really want tobebothered with whatever itisthat\nHowie Kessler wants from us.\n“Adele, thank yousomuch foryour kind hospitality. Ireally\nmean it.You’ve kept agood house allthese years forPunch!”\nHowie said, with asweet smile thatIdidn’t trust from amillion\nmiles away. Adele, however, melted.\n“Oh, Hon, you’re welcome! We’re justsohappy toseeyou\nafter allthese years. Imean, aHollywood star right here in\nNew Jersey—“ Adele gushed.\nIstopped herthere, before shegotcarried away. Itwasnow\nofficially anawkward moment, likeonthesteps ofthefront\nporch when the guy drops his date off. What does he do now?\n“Ok, Addie, Howie’s tired, I’msure,” Isaid, hoping hewould\ncatch thesend-off. Imade eye-contact with Adele, hoping she\nwould also catch my message.\n“Howie, Ihave your room allsetupupstairs, with new guest\ntowels, and fresh new sheets. You’re staying, right? Come.”\nOy.This can’t begood. Howie smiled, grabbed hisduffle and\nturned to follow Adele up the stairs.\n“Igotta leave here around 7:30am tohead into thecityfor\nmy cardio appointment. Will you—“\n“Great, I’llgoforarun, getthepaper, notaproblem. I’llbe\nhere when yougetback. Any joint around here Icangetthe\nRacing Form?” Howie said cheerfully.\n62\nItwas abeautiful, autumn Friday. Josh called andsaid he’d\ncome over ontheweekend with thekids andwecould doPT\nthen, ifitwasn’t toomuch trouble. Ofcourse, Isaid, since I\nhate thePT.SoAdele andIstopped forcoffee andsome pastry\natadiner inFt.Leeontheway home from thedoctor appoint-\nment. The cellphone rang; it was my daughter, Jessica.\n“Dad, I’msoglad youpicked up.I’mstanding inyour living\nroom andthere’s someone sleeping onyour couch. Iwould say\nit’sastranger, butitactually looks like Howard Kessler. Is\nHoward Kessler onyour couch?” shesaid calmly, butwith her\nvoice cresting with thetension ofnotknowing what todo—as\nshe has always done since she was a child.\n“Jess, Ididn’t know you were coming over! What anice\nsurprise!”\n“Dad, the guy?”\n“Hold on,your mother andIwere justleaving thediner, can\nI call you back? It’s a hassle to get out of here with the chair—“\n“Um, yeah, no,it’snot—can youtellmewhat’s going onbe-\nfore I start to freak out, please?”\nIhanded thephone toAdele, asIwheeled myself totheback\nexit.\n“Jess? Jessie? Hiit’sme, your father handed thephone to\nme—“\n“Tell herwe’ll beback in20minutes,” Iyelled toAdele.\n“Would youbring thecararound please? There’s astep onthe\ncurb back here.”\nWhen wepulled into thedriveway, there was Jessica sitting\nonthefront steps looking pissed and confused. Jessica isa\nwriter andhasbeen very successful asafreelance journalist,\never since shebroke outonherown. Ithink sheissuccessful.\nSheisforever beating herself upandisnever satisfied with her\ncareer. Sheputherself through graduate school after Isubsid-\nized acouple ofherbusiness ventures which didn’t work out.\nShewasalways agood writer, andI’mpleased she’s gone back\ntowriting. Shemoved toJersey City which isn’t toofarfrom us\nsoweseeheralittle more often now when she’s notonadead-\nline or travelling for a story.\nShe stood up to meet us in the driveway.\n“Hi, Ithink that guymay beawake. Isthat Howard Kessler,\nDad?”\n63\n“HiJess, it’ssonice toseeyou!” Isaid with abigsmile. Ijust\ndidn’t want to explain.\n“Why aren’t you explaining this? You’re avoiding my\nquestions.”\nAdele walked in the house after giving Jess a big hug.\n“It’s Howie Kessler. Buthe’s notthemovie star, while he’s\nhere at least, he’s an old friend from the old days in Brooklyn.”\n“Idon’t understand what youmean bythat. HeisHoward\nKessler, soheisacelebrity. Youhave acelebrity inthehouse.\nDoes thepress know? Doyourealize there willbepaparazzi\nhere any minute now? Can you even deal with that?”\nIhadn’t thought about paparazzi. Itsounded ridiculous. She\nwheeled meuptheramp andsure enough, Howie was atthe\ndoor waiting.\n“Ohmygoodness, isthisyour girl?” heasked, with ascharm-\ningadisposition ashecould muster inwhat appeared tobean\nincreasingly awkward situation.\n“Hi,I’mJessica, it’sreally nice tomeet youMr.Kessler. Ijust\ndidn’t expect to see you here, sorry if I alarmed you—“\n“That’s alright! Icanunderstand ifyour daddoesn’t want to\nsayanything,” Howie said ashesmiled andputhishand onmy\nshoulder.\n“I’m justsurprised there arenophotographers around,” Jes-\nsica said, probingly.\n“Yeah, I’mwith you,” Howie replied, peering outthefront as\niftospysomeone shooting anillicit photo. “But Idon’t think\nanyone knows I’m here, yet.”\nWe all looked at Adele.\n“Ijust told afewneighbors and friends that youmight be\ncoming,” Adele said sheepishly. “Come, I’llputsome coffee on,\nandwehave pastry from theplace inFt.Lee, Jess, theDanish\nyou love.”\nHoward probed Jessica about herjobandhertravels around\ntheworld. They enjoyed talking since hehadtraveled quite a\nbitand was sincerely interested inherthoughts and experi-\nences. Shecanhold herown with conversations with anyone.\nWhile they were talking, Iwas wondering what thehellIwas\ngoing todowith Howie, andforhow long hewasgoing tostay.\nJessica read mymind. Later that afternoon, sheasked what I\ndidn’t want to ask.\n64\n“SoMr.Kessler, what areyour plans? Areyougoing back to\nHollywood? Is there another movie in the works?”\n“Ah, you getstraight tothepoint! Smart girl you have,\nPunch,” Howie said ashelaughed. “I’lltellyouwhat. I’mhere\nonthedown-low andhoping toavoid exposure, soyour folks’\ngracious hospitality isreally helping outalot.I’dliketostay\nouthere forawhile, seetheboys, catch up.Idon’t really have\nany plans.”\n“Really? Because Ithought youmight have amovie planned\nor something,” Jess continued.\n“Nah, mylast project was cancelled, orIwas fired, or\nsomething. Mydays areprobably pretty numbered,” Howard\nresponded lightly.\n“Punch, let’s seewho else wecandigup.That okwith you?”\nHoward shifted the conversation. I caught Jess’s eye.\n“Yeah, I’mnotdoing anything andArtwanted toseeyou, too.\nHe was around a while back when we called you back.”\n“I’llletyoutwohave your time together, I’llbeintheother\nroom,” Howard started, “I’dliketotake youallouttodinner\ntonight, you have a local place you like? It’s on me.”\n* * * * * * *\nJessica waslaying onthecouch inthesunroom when Irolled\nback in,kicking thehassock asshetoyed with hercamera in\nher lap.\n“That a new camera? It looks fancy.”\n“It’s notmine. Myphotographer leftitinmybag, it’shis\nbackup. From ourtriplastweek toMontreal. Idon’t know shit\nabout cameras, Dad.”\n“Idon’t know, you always have something new you know\nabout.”\n“Igotthat from you, Mr.Engineer,” shesaid asshetinkered\nwith it.“You need tofind outwhat thefuck Howard isdoing\nhere, Dad, you know that, right?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Ishould write abook about thiswhole thing. It’ssobizarre,\nthat hejustshows uplikethis. Andhe’s really famous, Imean,\nlike, really famous. When Iwas inNairobi they were showing\nhisfilms inaretrospective lastyear atthestate theater—the\nSTATE theater,” she said.\n65\nIwatched asquirrel outside inastandoff with acrow over\nwhat looked like anacorn ontheneighbor’s driveway. They\nwere shouting ateach other theway Mrs. Grossman would\nshout atuskids ontheblock playing ball, breaking theocca-\nsional window. Jessica would probably write something about\nthis bizarre occurrence. Icouldn’t tellifshewas joking, or\nmusing, or trying to get a rise out of me.\n“Write whatever thehellyouwant. Justdon’t doittoexploit\nhim or me.”\n“You don’t trust him anymore than Ido,why areyoupro-\ntecting him?”\n“Ishould askmyself that question. We’ll see, we’ll justhave\nto see.”\n66\nChapter 12Frank\nMyphone rings theother day, I’moutonasiteand had no\ntime forbullshit. Idon’t recognize thenumber, it’ssomething\ninJersey soIfigure itcanwait. Bythetime Icould sitforafew\nminutes andlisten tothemessage, I’mdriving home intraffic\non the Belt and aggravated.\n“Frankie, Frank, thisisHowie Kessler. I’mwith Punch, I’min\ntown, let’s gettogether andseewhat wecandrum up.Would\nlove to see you.”\nIalmost drove offtheroad. Imust have listened tothemes-\nsage adozen times tomake sure itwasn’t ajoke, oreven one\nofthekids messing around since wewere justtalking about\nHowie lastweekend. Idialed thenumber andhung upequally\nasmany times, since Ijustcouldn’t puttogether thewords to\nsay after so many years—and I had so many questions.\nIjustcouldn’t deal with thisafter adaylikeI’vehad. Itwas\ntoomuch. Ifeltlikeamovie onthat channel mywife watches\nduring the day where all the women cry.\nItried togetsome resolve andclear myhead alittle, soI\npacked upthetruck anddrove upstate todosome fishing at\nthecabin. Imean, what doIneed thisshitfor?Mybest friend –\nmylastfriend –calling meafter 50years andawhole career of\nfame and inthemovies and all,it’soff.It’sjust off.So-\nmething’s offabout thewhole thing. And Punch? How thehell\nisheintouch with Punch? Ihaven’t heard from that guyin\nyears, either. Heleftusalmost asquickly asHowie did,tearing\noutofBrooklyn togotocollege. Itwas unheard ofinthose\ndays foroneofustogotocollege. Andwehadnoidea hewas\nplanning it. Like Howie, he just up and left.\nSowith thequiet weekend ahead away from thecalamity of\nmyfamily back home, and theride uptheThruway past the\n67\ntrees turning colors, Ithink canfinally think straight. IfIcall\nHowie back, I’llhave nothing tosay. Ihave nothing tooffer.\nWhat, arewegoing totalkabout theYankees? Arewegoing to\ntalk about his movies, each of which I’ve seen at least 3 times?\nIhaven’t really changed since wewere kids. Istill getin\ntrouble anddoalittle skimming here andthere. I’mstillabit\nofanasshole. I’mnobrain surgeon, either. IlikemyItalian\nfood andthat’s about it.Ilikefishing uphere inthecountry,\nbutIlikemyflatscreen TVanddigital cable. Ilikefootball,\nbaseball, andalittle basketball. Ifollow New York teams, ex-\ncept theMets. Istillfoolaround ontheside. Iread thePost\nevery daybecause ithasthebest sports section andI’mnotin-\nterested inanything elseother newspapers have. SolikeIsaid,\nnodifferent than inhigh school, except Ihave lesshair anda\nbigger belly. Istopped smoking, after thelung cancer scare\nabout 10 years ago.\nIliketopretend that ifHowie came back, we’d befriends\nagain, butthat we’d becruising around Bensonhurst inhisEs-\ncalade andliving thehigh lifeinstead ofshacked upintene-\nments likewewere askids. ButI’mbeing realistic andthere’s\nnohope ofthat now. We’re old,different people with awhole\nlot of shit in between us now.\n* * * * * *\nIwoke uptoday andthought about mydecision lastnight not\nto call Howie. I think I’ll call Howie.\n“Yeah, hi, I’m calling for Howie? Is this—“\n“Who is this?” the voice on the other line asked.\n“It’s Frank Russo, who the hell is this?”\n“Frankie? Oh Frankie! I can’t believe it! It’s me, Punch.”\n“Holy shit, Punch Plotkin! How many years hasitbeen? My\ngod, this is incredible, you know?”\n“Yeah, I’m—how are you? How are you?” he asked.\n“Me? I’mgood. I’mover here—I’m upinthecountry, upstate,\nat my cabin fishing this weekend.”\nIthought that wasanice place tostart. Ihadn’t expected to\ngetPunch onthelinefirst. Ididn’t think about Punch atall,to\nbehonest, because mymemories were dominated byHowie\nand though Iknew hementioned hewas with Punch inthe\nphone message, Ireally didn’t give itathought, because it\ndidn’t make much sense.\n68\nNow I really couldn’t figure out what was going on.\nWetalked forawhile, about ourkids, about theYankees, and\nArtatthehelm now, thereunion heattended afew weeks\nback. Itwas nice talking toPunch, Iremember what agood\nguyhewas back inthedayandhow hewas always there to\nlisten to the crap we each had to deal with.\n“Sohow didyougetback intouch with Howie?” Iasked him.\nHepaused before answering, likehewas trying tochoose the\nright words.\n“He called meup.Hedidn’t leave amessage. Iguess\nsomeone outonthecoast who knew mydaughter, anex-boy-\nfriend, raninto Howie and gave him mycellphone number.\nAnyway, long story short, ItoldArtandwecalled himback to-\ngether. Wegothimonthephone, andhehadalready planned\noncoming outhere,” hesaid, changing histone. “He’s staying\nhere. Been here about a week now.”\n“He’s staying atyour house? InJersey?” Ijustcouldn’t get\nover it.Why wouldn’t Howie Kessler beatoneofthose fancy\njoints inthecity? Theguycan’t possibly bebroke again, he’s\ngot to be sitting on millions.\n“Yeah, he’s here. Afinehouseguest, Isuppose. He’s outnow,\ndoes alotofjogging. He’s ingreat shape, bytheway. Idon’t\nknow what you’re up to, but this guy runs like he’s 21.”\n“Eh, they have trainers outthere inCalifornia. Imean, How-\nie’sgotpeople hecanhire todoallthat stuff. What arehis\nplans, anyway?”\n“Well, he wants us all to get together, first, and then—“\n“Who, us? You me and him? And Art?”\n“I think he also wants to track down Mo.”\nNow there’s someone Ihaven’t thought about inages, either.\nIdidn’t even know ifMowasstillalive. Theguycould bedead\n30years forallIknow. Last Iheard was through mylawyer,\nand Ihad tosign some papers stating Iwouldn’t beinMo’s\npresence because ofsome prosecution agreement or\nsomething. We were both messed upwith some raunchy\npeople.\n“You know if Mo’s, uh, uh—“ I asked Punch.\n“What, alive? Ihave noidea. Heshowed upatoneofthere-\nunions somany years agowired anddrunk andhewasamess.\n69\nHebrought ahooker. Years agoitwould have been funny, but\nit was just bad news.”\n“Idon’t know ifIknow how togetintouch with him. Iheard\nhehadquite thedrug business. Youknow wearen’t supposed\ntoeven talktoeach other because ofalegal thing from years\nback. Idoubt it’sstillineffect, butwho knows,” Isaid, wonder-\ningifthefriction between usthen would have anyeffect today.\nI don’t even remember what the hell went wrong back then.\n“No kidding? What happened between you?”\n“Itwasn’t between us,itwas between thepeople wewere\nworking for.When Mowasacourt reporter downtown, hewas\nstealing information and selling ittothemob. Iwas under\nthreat ofindictment ifIdidn’t speak upabout some ofthe\nthings Iwasinvolved in.Nooneknows, still, really, though I’m\nnotsure much ofitmatters anymore, butitcould be,you\nknow, sensitive. I don’t know.”\n“Well, we’ll justhave tolook himupsomehow andseewhat’s\nwhat,” Punch said. Hecontinued, “Look, Idon’t exactly know\nwhat Howie expects, or why the fuck he’s even here.”\nHe caught me by surprise. I perked up.\n“Imean, thisguycomes floating inafter allthese years, eats\nmygoddamned coffee cake and drinks green liquid from the\nblender hemakes with god only knows what, and lounges\naround here likewe’ve been roommates forthepast 50years.\nWhat the hell am I supposed to make of this?”\n“Jesus, Punch, why didn’t you say that earlier?”\n“Idon’t know, Idon’t even know what I’msaying. I’minthis\ngoddamned wheelchair andIgetmoody sometimes. ButIdon’t\nknow what’s next here,” hesaid, sounding resigned and\nexasperated.\n“Ok, then, sounds likeI’llmake atripinandwe’ll gettogeth-\ner.Ihaven’t talked tohimyet,youknow, butyouhave mycell\nsohave himgive meacallwhen hecan. Like Isaid I’mupin\nthecountry thisweekend soallI’mdoing isfishing andsleep-\ning.Ihave acourt date with oneofmyfuck-up kids next week\nbutotherwise I’maround, sowecanmeet outatyour place, or\nmy place, or the Spumoni Gardens, whatever’s good.”\n70\nChapter 13Howie Calls Alan\nIthadbeen weeks since Howie was intouch with anyone on\nthecircuit back inL.A. Hedidn’t even keep intouch with the\nnews andhadn’t picked upaVariety orHollywood Reporter.\nHejust wasn’t interested. Hehad other things planned. He\nwanted toletAlan know about hisrevelations while hewason\nhiscross-country trip, gethisthoughts, and move forward.\nOver theyears, Howard rarely made abigmove without run-\nning itbyAlan first—not that hewaslooking forAlan’s approv-\nal, but out of respect, he didn’t want to surprise him.\n“Hiya, buddy, I’mjustchecking intoletyouknow Ihaven’t\ngone off a cliff,” Howard said.\n“Well it’sgreat tohear from you, itreally is,I’msopleased\nyoufinally gotoffyour high horse and called me,youfuck,”\nAlan replied, with love.\n“Yeah, Iknow. Hey, listen, I’vebeen thinking alot—I’m in\nNew Jersey now—“\n“What? You’re where?”\n“New Jersey, Imade across-country road trip. Istopped in\nalltheMidwest states, orsomething likethat, drove alone, in\njust two and ahalf days. Itwas interesting. Ididalotof\nthinking—“\n“I’ll say.”\n“Yeah, well, ok,here’s thething, see, I’mtracking down\nsome ofmyoldbuddies, from back inthedayandI’mgoing to\ndoamovie about it.I’mgoing towrite ascript. I’mgoing to\ndirect it.Produce it.Everything. This willbemymagnum opus,\nAlan, and you’ll be with me all the way.”\n“Jesus, Howie, Imean, thisisallasurprise. I’mstillstuck on\nyoudriving outofL.A., how didyoueven manage that?” Alan\nasked, not sarcastically.\n71\n“No I’mserious, Alan, this iswhat Iwant todo.I’mdoing\nthis thing. Are you with me? I mean, we can do it, right?”\n“Let’s break thisdown. You’re writing ascript? First, what is\nthe story about? Have you ever written before?”\n“It’s about ourgang, what weused todo,and then about\nhow oneguybecomes anactor, likeme,heads outtoHolly-\nwood andmakes itbig,then comes back decades later tosee\nthedecrepitude ofwhat heleft, and thewhole thing, you\nknow.”\n“Sounds alright, yougotta dosomething about theending, I\nmean, something’s gottohappen. Something good, youknow?\nWe’re still Hollywood, after all.”\n“Yeah, yeah, Icandothat. Idon’t have italltogether now.\nI’mstaying with aguyouthere inJersey andI’mmeeting up\nwith some of the other guys. I’ll have a storyline together.”\n“You want metogetawriter? Imean, youhaven’t written\nbefore. Aghost-writer. Theguywho wrote theVietnam thing\nyouwere inyears ago, he’s good. Expensive, buthe’ll write it\nand you put your name on it. We can go that route.”\n“Idon’t know. Iwant todothismyself. Iwant thisthing tobe\nmy own, you know.”\n“Ok, we’ll seethen, youwork itoutandletmeknow where\nyouare.Icangetyouhelp, isall,sodon’t muddle through this.\nYou know, no one writes these things alone, except writers.”\nHoward would dotheproject onhisown. He’s had people\nholding hishand andtreating him likeachild. Heneeded to\nembark onhisown creative project toreinvent hisidentity in\nHollywood.\nHecame back into thehouse after making thecalloutin\nPunch’s back yard. Adele was inthekitchen reading theStar\nLedger atthetable. Shesitsontheedge ofherchair asifshe’s\nabout topopupatanymoment, butthat’s justhow shereads\nthepaper atthebreakfast table. Howard peered inthrough the\nscreen door andobserved thekitchen. Everything was neatly\ninitsplace, notaspeck ofgrime—the countertops andappli-\nances scrubbed. Butnone oftheappliances orcabinetry had\nbeen updated inatleast 25years, orlonger. The shine was\nscrubbed offthemetal. Thedish towels andplastic tablecover\ncontained designs and colors—green, brown, orange\nflowers—that hadn’t been infashion since thelate 1970s.\n72\nThere was acabinet mounted onthewall oftrinkets. Thekit-\nchen wall clock ticks, butnotinunison with theother ticking\nclocks throughout thehouse, sothecombination ofticking\ntones creates a din.\nHoward stepped inside and smiled atAdele ashewalked\nslowly byherinto thedining room. Hands clasped behind his\nback, hestepped sideways between thetable andthemirror-\nlined hutch that holds thedisplayed plates andglassware. The\ndining room iscramped. Hestepped back andsquinted toima-\ngine entertaining in there with people seated around the table.\nHewalked through totheliving room where thewalls were\ncovered inashiny patterned wall covering. Itwas sougly he\nwas glad there were framed photos nearly floor toceiling. He\nglanced atthephotos, butdidn’t really care somuch about\nthem. Photos ofother people’s families didn’t make anysense\ntoHoward. Hewalked down theshort stairs totheden. This\nwas asplit level home, sothelayouts areallnearly identical.\nThe homes were allbuilt inthe1970s, soHoward hadnever\nbeen inside one. Hewasonsetsbuilt tolook likeinteriors, with\nlittle sets of stairs everywhere.\nHesatdown intheden onthereading chair adjacent to\nPunch, who had dozed offmoments earlier. Hewondered if\nthisisthelifehewould have hadifhehadn’t taken thepath he\ndid.Hewasn’t sure ifhewasactually envious, butthere wasa\nserenity andacalmness thathehadn’t ever experienced before\nstaying with the Plotkins.\nHoward satand enjoyed thelight streaming intotheden\nthat morning, and skipped getting theDaily Racing Form or\nwatching thenews. Hedidn’t talk; heonly listened tothequiet,\nand the ticking of the clocks.\n73\nChapter 14Jessica The Writer\n“Can I call him, then, Dad, directly, I mean?” I asked my dad.\n“Honey, he’s busy, he’s abusy guy. Thenext commissioner of\nbaseball is a busy guy.”\n“Soyoudon’t want metotalktohim? Because Ithought you\nwere onboard with this project.”\n“No, it’soktotalk tohim, goahead, talk tohim. I’mjust\ntelling youhe’s avery busy guy. Idon’t know ifyou’ll even be\nable to get in touch with him.”\nIhaddecided onedaylastweek when Icame over toDad’s\nhouse andHowie wasonhisphone intheback yard, furtively. I\ndidn’t likeit.Idon’t liketheguy. Idon’t seewhy myfolks are\nbuying this, butIcan’t convince them otherwise andHowie is\ntruly anabsolute charmer. Ididn’t know what hisintentions\nwere with myparents; Ididn’t really care about theother guys\nbutIdidn’t want mydadgetting hurt. This thing wassoweird\nalready. Imean, there’s oneofthemost successful (but admit-\ntedly onthedownside ofhiscareer) celebrities sleeping onmy\nfather’s couch in Englewood, New Jersey.\n“Ok, I’llstart with Artbutalsowork oninterviewing someone\nelse while hetakes histime togetback tome,how does that\nsound?”\n“Fine, it’s fine, whatever you want, you’re the writer.”\nI hate when he does that.\nIthought Iwould start with Mo,anyway, since heseemed to\nbethemystery thateveryone wasreally interested in;andfrom\nhow mydaddescribes him, hewas really thesmartest outof\nthegang, sohisperspective onHowie isprobably themost in-\nteresting. I’mtrying nottoproject and turn this into fiction,\nbut Iwant tomake abrutally honest and comprehensive\n74\naccount ofHoward Kessler—through theeyes ofhischildhood\nfriends—as I can.\nMoisalso theonethat nooneknows how togetintouch\nwith.\nOne phone calltoafriend attheD.A.’s office and Ihad a\ncouple ofphone numbers andawork address. Idrove outto\nSheepshead Bay, Brooklyn onasunny Thursday morning. Ihad\nnever been there. Dad was never interested intaking usback\ntowhere hegrew up,andhaving spent myformative years in\nBergen County, Ididn’t make ittoBrooklyn with theexception\nofthehipster clubs inWilliamsburg andfrou frou restaurants\nonSmith Street inCarroll Gardens…another world away from\nBrighton Beach, Bensonhurst, Coney Island and Sheepshead\nBay.\nMo’s work address listed alarge health club. Itisafreest-\nanding building right offEmmons Avenue with ahuge yellow\nneon sign, and floor-to-ceiling windows onitsthree floors. I\nwalked inandasked thereceptionist where IcanfindMo.She\nlooked at me like I had ten heads.\n“Does he work here anymore?” I asked.\n“Idon’t know what you mean—he doesn’t work here, he\nowns here. He doesn’t come in probably next week though.”\n“Can you tell me where I can find him now?”\n“That bad, huh? Icangive youacellnumber, Ican’t tellyou\nwhere heisthough. He’s usually good about answering his\nmessages.”\nAsshewaswriting down thenumber onacard, Icouldn’t fig-\nureoutwhat shemeant byhercomment. Sometimes people\njustsayweird things soIdidn’t think about itmuch. Butitwas\nsomething to catalogue for when I do meet him.\nItwasadifferent number than thetwoIhadfrom theD.A.’s\noffice. AsIexited thebuilding andwalked tomycar,athinwo-\nman in spandex pants and matching jacket called to me.\n“You’re looking to find Mo?”\n“Yes, that’d be great.”\n“Who are you?”\n“I’m justthedaughter ofanoldfriend ofhisandwashoping\ntospeak with himabout some news,” Ianswered, notthinking\nthat what Iwas doing could have been construed asillicit in\nany way.\n75\n“Ifyougoouttotheharbor, past thecharter boats, you’ll see\nacouple ofhouse boats. Theonewith theblue andwhite flagis\nMo’s.”\n“Really? Aboat? That’s great—thanks somuch, Ireally ap-\npreciate it. Can I tell him you gave me the info?”\n“Please don’t do that, I’m not on his favorites list right now.”\nIdidn’t delve further, even though Iwanted to,Iwasn’t writ-\ningastory about Mo,Iwaswriting apiece about Howard and\nneeded Mo’s experience andperspective. Butthere were cer-\ntainly enough details already that made methink I’mwriting\nthe wrong story.\nIkept thecarwhere itwas and walked through thedamp\nmorning airtotheharbor. Ifound theboat thatthewoman had\nmentioned, butIhad noidea how toboard it.There was no\ndoorbell oranything, anditwas justattached byacouple of\nropes. Istood there forafewminutes wondering ifIshould\njust jump on.\nAsIwalked closer togauge thedistance ofthejump, Isaw\nsomeone walking around inside through the windows. I\nstepped back amoment towatch him. This hastobeMo. He\nhashisshirt offandisholding acigarette andatake-out cupof\ncoffee inonehand andhisphone tohisearintheother. He\nlooks pissed. Ican’t hear anything because ofthewater slap-\nping against theboats and thepier and thewind across the\nharbor. Inhisanimation yelling into thephone, hespills his\ncoffee andfumbles with thecigarette, thenow half-empty cup,\nand the phone, still arguing verbally and physically.\nIstood andwatched forafewmore moments justvoyeurist-\nically without having any intention ofboarding theboat to\nspeak with himatthispoint. I’llcome back. Iturned towalk\nback tothecar. Afewsteps down thepier someone grabbed\nmy arm and swung me around. I didn’t even hear him coming.\n“What are you doing here?”\nItwas Mo, presumably. What thehell amIgetting into?\nThere isn’t asoul insight. Idon’t know thisguy. Hecould bea\nfucking murderer, andmay have been oneback when mydad\nknew him. Myheart raced andIhadtrouble spitting outthe\nsimple words that I needed to in order to defuse the situation.\nHisgrip wastighter onmyarmandheraised hisvoice. “Who\nare you? You better be fucking lost, girlie.”\n76\nItook adeep breath. “My name isJessica Plotkin. Youknew\nmyfather, Karol, Ithink—are youMo?” Isaid feebly. Iamun-\nused tobeing scared. Ihaven’t been oneofthose journalists on\nthefront ofawarzone, andmyexposes haven’t exactly probed\ninto theunderworld. The most dangerous situation Iwas in\nwasgetting stuck intheairport atPhuket before thetorrential\nstorms inSoutheast Asia when Iwas doing astory ongirls’\nsecondary education in Cambodia.\n“He’s dead?”\nThose words seemed tosnap usboth outofmyfear andhis\nsuspicion.\n“No, my dad? No, he’s not dead—“\n“Then why’d yousay‘you knew’ him? Youmade issound like\nhe’s dead—“\n“No, I’msorry, it’sjustthat itismyunderstanding that you\nguys haven’t been intouch inyears, soitwould have been\nweird tosayyouknow him, because, well, really, youprobably\ndon’t.”\nHe looked at me quizzically.\n“Sorry, thiswasn’t theright timing, Ihadawhole different\nspeech prepared—“\n“Let megetthis straight, Punch isnotdead; you’re his\ndaughter you said?”\n“Yeah, I’m here because I wanted to talk to you about—“\n“How isPunch?” hesmiled andinstead ofgripping myarm\nlikehewasgoing tobreak itoff,hegrasped both myarms and\nstood meinfront ofhim toinspect me. “You look like him!\nSame nose!”\nHeobviously didn’t know that I’vebeen conscientious ofmy\nnose for years so it wasn’t the way to my heart.\n“He’s good, he’s, uh,losthislegandrolls around inthechair\nquite nicely now. Diabetes. Helives inNew Jersey andretired\nacouple years agofrom AT&T.” How could Isummarize my\ndad’s past 50years (especially when I’veonly been around for\n30) to this guy?\n“His leg? Wow, Ican’t getover that. Punch was soathletic.\nHekicked myassallthetime over onthecourts,” pointing in\nthedirection, ofBrighton Beach where they used toallplay\npickup basketball. “He OKotherwise, though? Hey I’dlove to\nsee him—“\n77\n“He’s fine, yeah, andhe’d liketogettogether, too—Howard\nKessler ishere andalso wants togettogether, butI’llletyou\nguys chat about that.”\n“What? What isallthisgoing on?Howie’s back? Iwas just\nthinking about that guy,” hesounded confused andIguess it\nwas alltoomuch atonce. Whatever hethought Iwas doing\nspying onhim, plus theblasts from thepast, itseemed likehis\nhead was spinning. He wasn’t wearing shoes.\n“You have afewminutes?” Heasked. “I’llbuyyouacupof\ncoffee. I’msorry forjumping onyoulikethat, itmust’ve scared\nyoualittle. You wouldn’t believe thepeople outhere—” he\ntrailed offbutIknew that he’s gotpeople after him. Youdon’t\nactlikethat, liveonaboat, andcome running barefoot after\npeople on the dock, if you’re an innocent bystander.\nWe walked over to a diner across the street for a coffee.\n“I’dliketowrite astory about youguys, andHoward. Iwas\nhoping togetyour thoughts, memories, experiences. Raw, un-\nbiased, asyouremember them. Areyouupforthat?” Iasked\nbluntly. Ididn’t want toinsinuate anything about Howard, and\nhow I didn’t like what I thought he might be up to.\n“What kind ofstory? Imean, Idon’t know what your dadhas\ntold youabout me,butIdon’t exactly want anyspotlight on\nme.”\n“No, ofcourse, Iunderstand. Ifyou’d liketoremain anonym-\nous, that’s fine, Ithink Icanwork with that. It’stherecollec-\ntions that are important. Above all, I want to be truthful.”\nIcan’t believe Isaid that. Itwas likeJournalism 101. And,\nfrankly, I’mnotsosure Iwanted tobetruthful, butIhadno\nidea ofthebackground between MoandHoward, orbetween\nany of the gang, so I tread lightly.\n“Lemme think about it.I’mabusy guy, youknow, Iown that\nhealth club over there.”\nIcould seehisfull-of-shitness andwas alittle disappointed\nhethought Iwould buyit.Iwasstraddling afineline: ajourn-\nalist andasubject’s daughter. Ihadtobealittle more flexible\nthan I ordinarily would have been.\n“Well, Icame alltheway outhere hoping atleast togeta\nlittle background onyour relationship with Howard back when\nyouwere young, andthelasttime youwere intouch with him,\nyou know, some basic stuff.”\n78\n“You don’t have amicrophone oranything, arecorder,\nright?”\n“No, notthistime. Imean, notforthisproject. Irecognize\nthesensitivities. Youcanattribute when andwhere youwant. I\njust askyouonething inreturn: that youdon’t tellHoward\nabout this in any form at all whatsoever.”\nHeputhiscupdown andglared atme.Iwasscared again. I\ngottheconfidence toconfront himonmyterms, andhethen\nsquashed mewithout words. Jesus, thisguyispowerful. Why\namIdoing thisstory, again? IfIfeellikeI’minover myhead\nbefore theinterviews even begin, Ishould goback tocovering\nNPR stories on woodcarving artists’ communes in Wyoming.\n“What the fuck are you doing? Who do you think you are?”\nFuck. Fuck. Fuck!\nIstared back athimforthelongest fewseconds inthehis-\ntory oftime. Ifeltmybody temperature rise tothepoint I\nthought myears would combust. The whole story isabust if\nHoward finds outabout it.This thing could godown thedrain\nbefore I even put pen to paper.\n“Eh, I’monly kidding. Lighten up,willya?How about some\nblintzes? This joint makes great blintzes.” Andhemotioned for\nthe waitress.\n79\nChapter 15Jessica Meets Frank\n“Mr. Russo, please?” Iasked thewoman onthephone. I\nthought thiswashiscellphone, butareceptionist answered so\nI asked for him.\n“Who’s calling, please?” she asked.\n“This isJessica Plotkin, thedaughter ofanoldfriend ofhis,\nKarol.”\nThelinesounded likeitwent dead foramoment. Istopped to\nlook at my phone to see if we were still connected.\n“Hello?” I asked.\nAfter some shushing andtheapparent sound ofahand cover-\ningthephone, Frank answered thephone. Itsounded likehe\nwas in bed.\n“Yeah, hullo?”\nIstraightened uptonotsound likeIwas suspicious that he\nwas sleeping with hissecretary inthemiddle oftheday, and\nsheanswered hiscelllikeshewould have hisoffice phone. But\nIdidn’t know enough about theguytomake that assumption. I\njust like imagining.\n“Hi, Mr.Russo? This isJessica Plotkin, Ibelieve myfather\nhad letyouknow I’dbecalling? Totalk about, um, Howard\nKessler?”\n“Oh, of course, honey, sure. Right—“\n“Icancallback another time; orcome meet youatyour con-\nvenience. Icanunderstand ifnow isnotagood time,” Isaid,\nhoping hewould agree, since Icould tellbyhisvoice that he\nwas laying down.\n“Uh, maybe, I’m in the middle of something now—“\nIdidn’t want himtohave toexplain anymore. Ifhewasthis\nbadatlying athome, Iwould beamazed athow hiswife stays\naround, unless she’s out doing the same thing.\n80\n“Why don’t wemeet tomorrow afternoon? Can youcome to\nBrooklyn around 3intheafternoon? Cristofo Colombus Bakery\non 18th Avenue. ”\n“Sure, that sounds great. I love cannoli.”\nIwas looking forward tothecannoli, butnotsomuch in\nmeeting this guy.\nMydadsaid that Frank was Howard’s loyal soldier. Ididn’t\nknow what thatmeant. Ithought itwasbetter formetogointo\nthis without asmuch context asmyfather would have been\nable toprovide, since Ididn’t want towrite itwith hisper-\nspective. But Ineeded alittle background, just toconnect\nsome of the dots.\nWemetandhewasagracious host, atabakery heseemed to\nown—when Ipointed outwhat Iwanted inthecase, hewalked\nback and retrieved ithimself. Hehelped himself tothees-\npresso machine and made methebest cappuccino I’ve ever\nhad; and for himself an espresso.\n“So, honey, what arewetalking about?” hesaid ashesmiled,\nlooked down at me, and seemed a bit smug.\n“First, Iwant tothank youforallthisandfortaking thetime.\nI know you’re busy with your work.”\n“Eh, I’mhitting that agenow where they don’t letmegoout\nonthesites asmuch asIused to,sotaking thetime during the\nday isn’t a big deal. Fire away.”\n“Since Howard’s back intown, Ijustwanted togetyour ini-\ntialthoughts. I’mwriting apiece onHoward andwould liketo\nkeep itasmuch indraft form until Ihave something aspol-\nished as possible before I let anyone else know about it, so—“\nHesatforward inhischair andputdown hisespresso. The\nclang ofthecupagainst thesaucer caused thelittle spoon to\njump offitonto themarble table, making alouder noise than I\nexpected. I’m not sure if it was deliberate.\n“You should know that Idon’t talk tojournalists. Imean, I\nhave avoided thequestions about myown lifeandthepeople I\nknow for years because of certain, uh—“\n“Sensitivities?” Ifinished thesentence forhim. Ihate when\npeople struggle forwords and Iknow what they’re trying to\nsay.\n“Yes, that’s a good term for it. I’m glad you understand.”\n81\n“Iwon’t pryintothose areas, then, sir,Iamjustinterested in\nyour relationship with Howard then and now; and ingetting\nsome context into what you guys used to do back then.”\nNotreally, butatleast that wasagood enough introduction\ntotrytomake himfeelcomfortable. Ilearned mylessons from\nMo.\n“Howard and mewere best friends. Closer than anyone.\nDon’t letanyone tellyoudifferent. Howie andmegrew upto-\ngether since wewere kids. Really young. Lived next door to\neach other. Welooked outforeach other. Hehad toomany\nparents, Ihadnone. Wewere outonthestreets hustling for\nmoney asearly asIcould remember. Westole bikes, balls,\njackets, whatever wecould getourhands on.Wehadnoone\nguiding us to do good or bad.\n“For me,theworst memories—Howie always gotthegirls, I\ngot his seconds.”\n“And the best?”\n“He’s Howie Kessler, it was all good.”\nThat’s when Iknew Iwasn’t getting thetruth outofthisguy\nas easily as getting a cannoli.\nIfIcould justgeteveryone together, Icould document the\ndynamic, thereunion, theemotion, anditcould bereally com-\npelling. ButsofarArt’s schedule hasproved difficult toaccom-\nmodate; andwith allthistime going by,Howard isjusthanging\naround mydad’s house likeapiece offurniture. Ican’t tellif\nhe’s depressed, orjust waiting. Waiting forwhat? Mydad\ndoesn’t seem tomind somuch. They each now have their\nroutines; Howard even helps mydadoutwith hisphysical ther-\napy. It’sreally nice, actually. Butit’sbeen twoweeks. What the\nhell are this guy’s plans?\nFinally, we hear from Art.\n82\nChapter 16Art\nAdmittedly, I’vebeen avoiding theHowie situation forweeks\nnow. Atfirst Iwas curious—it was such anovelty Icouldn’t\nstay away. Idon’t have much else going oninmylifebesides\nMajor League Baseball. Mypartner, Yuri, andIarelikepassing\nships inthenight andwith allmytravelling, wehardly spend\nanytime together. Ialmost feellikegiving uponrenewing any\nrelationship with either ofmykids, who seem more andmore\nestranged every day. I’verealized it’snotmyrelationship with\nYuri that repulses them, it’s everything about me.\nSowhen thecallfrom Punch came, Ijumped attheopportun-\nitytocultivate some warmth andconnections. Iwanted tore-\nsurface myown identity again, now that I’minmy60s. I’ve\nbeen lostforalong time andIthought that Howie, Punch, and\nthe other guys could fill that void.\nItwasn’t justtalking tomytherapist that dissuaded mefrom\nattempting topursue this route toself-healing. Itwas one\nphone call with Punch’s daughter, a writer.\n“Well it’sgreat tomeet youover thephone. Punch hastold\nmeabout youover theyears. Youknow wegettogether about\nonce or twice a year to catch up.”\n“Yes! That’s right! I’mjust now putting thenames tothe\nfaces, sotospeak, soit’sallcoming together forme,” shesaid,\nsounding enthusiastic about thecall, though Istillwasn’t sure\nwhat theintended purpose was. Ihadonly spoken with Punch\nforafewminutes acouple ofweeks agowhen hecalled meto\ntell me how bizarre it was to have Howie staying at the house.\n“Sowhat canIdoforyou? Your father tells meyou’re inter-\nested in writing a story about Howie?”\n83\n“Well, yes,notreally, I’majournalist andI’mputting togeth-\nersome facts forastory about Howard’s return toBrooklyn,\nyou know, with his leaving Hollywood and all.”\n“Ah-ha. Itisinteresting, Ithink! I’mnotreally inthebusiness\nsoIdon’t know much about Hollywood. Infact, hadyour father\nand Inotpursued Howie’s callafewweeks ago, Iwouldn’t\nhave even known about himleaving Hollywood,” which wasn’t\ntrue, since Yuri issadly addicted toPeople magazine and\nwould have no doubt mentioned it to me if I hadn’t first.\n“Iknow you’re really busy andhave ademanding schedule\nwith your travelling. Butisthere some time soon Icancome\nmeet youandwecantalkabout some questions Ihave about\nyou, Howie, and the gang back then?”\n“Sure, Ithink wecanmanage something. I’llputyouonwith\nmyassistant inasecsoyoucanwork outwith himwhen works\nbest. I’mintown forthenext week orsoanditshould work out\nfine.”\n“Oh that’s wonderful, thank you somuch, Ipromise this\nwon’t beawaste ofyour time. I—there’s alotI’dliketolearn\nabout you, andwith Howie atmydad’s house, youknow, it’s\nbeen hard to get a real 360 on the guy.”\nIknew atthispoint shehadanangle. Myvery first instinct\nwasofdefense. ButIthought forjustamoment, what amIde-\nfending? I’vebeen working with journalists foragood portion\nofmycareer. Iknow what they do.Iknow that there isnever\nanything youcantellthem which willappear asunblemished\nasyouhadintended it.Sogenerally, mydistrust isrelatively\nhigh, soIamguarded. Butthiswas oneofmyoldest friends’\ndaughters, andIsensed atension inhertone that wasn’t the\nprofessional tension ofahardened journalist getting toastory.\nShewasouttoprotect herfather. After all,here’s aHollywood\nstar living inherfather’s house, with noapparent objectives.\nApparent.\nJessica met meatmyoffice and wewent foralate lunch\naround thecorner atNaples 45,afrequent stop forbaseballers\natthenorth endofGrand Central Station. Herinterest inthe\ngame orbusiness ofbaseball wasnil,soIdidn’t waste time on\na tour.\n84\n“How onEarth does your father, adie-hard Yankees fan,not\ntrain you tofollow baseball?” Ihad toask, before wegot\nstarted.\n“Eh, Ijustcouldn’t sitstillforthat long tofollow agame. I\ncollected thecards because mybrother did,butIwasintowrit-\ningand journalism, thearts, very early on.Mydad never\npressed me. As long as I did well in school, he was happy!”\n“That makes enough sense Isuppose. Well, then, what canI\ntell you?”\n“Do you know what Howie is doing here now?”\nIwas alittle shocked atherforthright question. Ididn’t\nknow how toanswer it,since, ifshewasasgood awriter asI\nthought shemay be,however Ianswered itwasgoing toframe\nthe whole conversation.\n“Idon’t know. When wespoke onthephone acouple of\nweeks agohesounded likehewasjustfedupwith Hollywood\nandyearned foratriphome. Youknow, we’re allgetting older,\ninour60snow, and Isuppose there’s alittle soul-searching\nhappening. Ihave noidea about hiscareer now, though Iguess\nit’sstillgoing strong. Fewer tough-guy roles, butthat thing he\nwas in last year, the war movie, was perfect for him.\n“Why doyouthink he’s here?” Iasked, probing forhertem-\nperature on this whole deal.\n“Ihave noidea,” sheseemed annoyed. “It’s given meagreat\nstory towrite, Ithink, butIcan’t getahandle. He’s charming,\nsweet, generous, andyetatthesame time Ifeellikehe’s plan-\nning something. Idon’t know. Ijustdon’t want, youknow, it’s\nmy dad—“\n“No, Ihear you. It’savalid concern. Thewhole thing’s alittle\nweird.”\n“You know, Italked toMo,andhave hisstory, andtoFrank,”\nsheseemed tobeopening uptomeless asajournalist and\nmore asaconcerned party. I’mnotsure Ihadanything tooffer\nin the way of mitigating.\n“Really? Wow, you’ve hittheground running. What arethose\nguys upto?Eh,I’msure I’llfindoutwhen wegettogether –do\nyou have any details on that?”\nWespoke foragood hour andthen Ihadtogetback tothe\noffice for a conference call.\n85\nIthink Howie isplanning something, sonow although I’dlike\ntobow outand excuse myself from whatever festivities are\nplanned, mycuriosity isgetting thebest ofme. And forthe\nsake ofmygood friend, Punch, I’dliketoensure things don’t\ngo off the rails.\n86\nChapter 17The Gang\nThey finally allagreed toadate andatime. Theplace waseasy\ntoagree on—The Peking Duck House onMott Street, oneof\nNew York’s great Chinese restaurants. Punch was unsure if\nJessica could bethere andshewas anxious torecord there-\nunion, butatthesame time acknowledged thedesire ofthe\ngang tostay intimate. Two days before they were slated to\nmeet, Alan called Howard toconfirm with him that hedidn’t\nwant anymedia tomeet himattherestaurant. Herecommen-\ndedthatthepublicist brief Howard intheevent someone atthe\nrestaurant called paparazzi and the press during the dinner.\n“Idon’t need that crap anymore, don’t yousee? I’mstarting\nonanew venture andifthepress come meet me,then fine, I\ncanhandle it.IfeellikeI’mworking formyself now. Nostudios\nto answer to,” Howard said.\n“Don’t make meremind you, butLew hastofinalize thatwith\nthestudio. Don’t jump thegun,” Alan gently nudged Howard.\nLew isHoward’s lawyer and wasn’t happy about therecent\ncontract action bythestudio inaxing Howard, sohewas\nchomping at the bit to get back to them with some demands.\n“Listen, Ican’t think about that crap now, Ihave togomeet\nthese guys soon. Ihave toplan outhow I’mgoing toframe this\nthing.”\nItwas Alan’s jobtokeep Howard Kessler, asabusiness en-\ntity, inhealthy condition. Hewasn’t convinced Howard was\nmaking thebest choices forhiscareer. Theleast Alan could do\nwas tostop thebleeding. Alan also wasn’t convinced that\nHoward could write ascreenplay—if there waseven astory to\nwrite about. Heheld outhope thattherendez-vous wouldn’t go\nwell and that he would scrap the idea and come back to L.A.\n“You’re one stubborn bastard, Howie,” Alan said.\n87\n“You should come out.”\n“Huh?”\n“No, Imean it.You should come out. You gotta seethese\nguys tobelieve them. Iknow you’re notbehind thismovie, but\nonce youmeet them, Ipromise you’ll understand where I’m\ntrying togowith this. These guys, they’re—they’re actually\npathetic.”\n“You gotta becareful. Imean, from what you’ve told me,\nthese guys aren’t exactly pussycats.”\nAlan thought about Howard’s invitation. Itmay just bethe\nbest way to reign him in, to go to New York.\n“When doyouwant me? Ihave meetings, youknow,” Alan\nsaid sheepishly.\n“Tomorrow. Get out here tomorrow.”\n* * * * * *\nThey were already running abitlateforthe7pm reservation.\nItwaspouring rain; outofplace weather inthemid-autumn, so\nAlan’s plane wasinevitably latecoming intoJFKAirport. Ithad\nbeen years since Alan had been in New York.\nHowie Kessler walked intherestaurant and shook offthe\nrain, handing hisumbrella andjacket tothefirst waiter who\nwalked by.Hehadhoped tocome earlier sohecould grab a\ndrink ortwo atthebarbefore going tothetable. Then he\nfigured he was late already, he could still grab that drink.\n88\nChapter 18Alan Comes to New York\nIdon’t likethisatall.I’veseen people trytoreinvent their ca-\nreers bydoing really stupid things. Facelifts, haircuts, younger\ngirlfriends, stupid PRstunts. But Howard Kessler writing a\nscreenplay justdidn’t sitright with me.Ilistened tohimwhen\nhesaid Ishould seethese characters inorder tobelieve them,\nsoIkept anopen mind andhoped that hewasright. Theother\nhalfoftheequation layinthequestion: isthere astory there\nandifso,could hewrite it?I’mtrying tocontain anydisasters.\nThis ismycareer. Istillhave afewyears leftinme.IfHoward\ngoes down, Igodown. Skipping town likehedidisjust not\ndone—it leaves the door open tospeculation. And with\nHoward’s past, thespeculation wasn’t good. I’ve worked too\nhard tobuild upwhat Ihave toseeitcome toanendbecause\nsome Hollywood schmuck gets oldand wants torevisit the\nfame and adulation he had years before.\nNotthat Howie isaschmuck. Weareloyal friends andpart-\nners in his career. But it’s time I get an insurance policy.\nHowie sent acartopick meupattheairport andsince Iwas\nsolate, Ihadtogostraight totherestaurant andnotthehotel\nfirst. Iamsticky andtired sothisfood hadbetter begood. Iget\noutofthecarandit’spouring, cold, andcrowded onthestreet.\nHorns arehonking because there was nowhere forthedriver\ntopull over andMott isaone-way street. Ihadtoschlep my\nbaginto therestaurant andgive theguy$20 toputitinthe\nback andmake sure noonewalks away with it.Iknew Iwasn’t\nin L.A. anymore.\nTheguywasshowing metothetable, butInoticed Howie in\nthebarfirst. I’mglad Idid,because Idon’t know what kind of\nintroduction Howie hadintended onmaking totheguys orif\nthey even knew I was going to be here.\n89\n“What’s thematter, youcan’t face your past?” Isaid, slap-\nping him on the back and only half-joking.\n“Ah, thanks alotforcoming outhere. Iknow it’salong trip,\nbut it really means a lot.”\n“I’m starving. Yousaythisisthebest Chinese joint inNew\nYork?”\n“Yeah, itsure is,”hesaid, looking straight ahead andseem-\ning a little dazed.\n“You ok?” I asked.\nHeseemed tosnap outofit,though Icould tellhewas\ndistracted.\n“These things aren’t always easy, even ifyouhave anagenda\nplanned oranexitstrategy,” Isaid, sensing that areunion was\nwhat was bothering him.\n“Nah, it’s not that, I—“\nTheheadwaiter tapped meontheshoulder toshow ustothe\ntable.\n“Iguess everyone ishere already, weshould go,” Isaid, not\nwanting tocuthimoff,butatthesame time Iknew that once\nhestarts thinking toohard about things, hecould getalittle\ndestructive. Especially at the bar.\nAswewalked tothelarge ,round table inasecluded corner\noftherestaurant, Howie picked uphispace andIcould seehis\ngrin.\n“Holy Christ, look atyouguys! Look atyou! You oldbas-\ntards!” Howie said andembraced andshook hands allaround.\n“Punch Iseeyouevery daynow, butalltogether Ican’t get\nover this! The whole mishpucha’s here!”\nOne guystarted totear up.Hewasabigguyandseated on\ntheother side ofthetable andhadastunned look onhisface\nand tears started streaming down his face.\n“Buddy, I—I’m, thisiswhat I’vebeen waiting forforsomany\nyears, somany years,” hestood upandreached across togive\nHowie ahug. Heheld onforthat awkward extended moment\nthat you see in movies.\n“Ihope you guys haven’t been here toolong—you could\ncatch upwithout me! Hey listen, thisisAlan Shiner, he’s my\nagent andjusthappened tobeinNew York tonight foraclient,\nso I hope you don’t mind if he joins us,” Howard slipped in.\n90\n“No, ofcourse not,great tohave you, Alan,” said agracious\nman inawheelchair, who Ilearned wasPunch, theguyHowie\nhad been staying with for the past couple of weeks.\n“We were justgetting used tothegimp, here. Hecertainly\nhasn’t losthispiss andvinegar, though!” said aman with the\nlargest hands I’veever seen forsomeone who isn’t aprofes-\nsional athlete, I later learned was Mo.\n“Yeah, jesus, what asurprise, huh? Imean, youlook great,\notherwise, buddy!”\n“And that’s Frank, Alan, theguywith theleast tact—“ Howie\njoked.\nThey alltalked asifthey hadn’t spent adayapart. They\njoked about thegames they used toplay askids andhow they\nused tohave therunoftheneighborhood. Then about how\nthey used toshoot pool andhustle atthepool hall; their club\nroom; mischief.\n“You know, Inever knew how badIhaditasakiduntil Igot\ntohigh school,” Punch said, “we hadsuch agood time andI\nhave such warm memories.”\n“Yeah, youpretty much turned into anasshole when wegot\ntohigh school,” Howie joked, “I’m serious, youreally hardened\nin high school.”\n“Ithink youdid,too,Howie, later on,Imean,” Punch retor-\nted, but non-confrontationally.\n“May have been when hesethissights onHollywood,” I\nadded.\n“Oh Howie hadbeen ashowman inoneform oranother for\nyears,” Artsaid. Icouldn’t tell,though, ifthere wasasubtext,\nthough I suspected there was.\n“You know, Punch, you’re right. Ithink Ifeltthesame way. I\nmean, weused torunaround andhave agreat time together\nwhen wewere young kids. Iremember realizing when wegot\ntohigh school that wereally had nothing. Wegrew upwith\nnothing. Ididn’t even have atoy,between me,mybrother and\nsister, andmyeight cousins Igrew upwith intheapartment,\nwe didn’t have one toy,” Howard recollected.\nHoward seemed sincerely touched and excited about the\nwhole evening.\nUntil a certain point.\n91\nIdon’t know ifitwasbecause they were allputting away the\nbooze (and who drinks forChinese food?), buttheease ofthe\nconversation inthebeginning—as ifthey were picking up\nwhere they leftoff50years ago—didn’t continue seamlessly. I\nthought itwould. Everyone was getting along sowell. Isatsi-\nlently enjoying theconversation andtherecollections oftheold\ndays—much ofitmirrored myown experience and Iwas de-\nlighted to revel in some very similar memories.\n“Iwonder what ever happened tothat fatandloud girlyou\ndated, Frankie, Iforgot hername—“ Howie asked, “What a\npig,” with a guffaw I hadn’t heard come out of him in years.\nThey allseemed togosilent foramoment that feltmuch\nlonger than itwas. Before anyone hadachance tomake eye\ncontact with Howie, Frankie answered back, with alook onhis\nface of utter anguish.\n“Imarried her. She’s mywife. She gave me4kids. Four\nfucked upkids, butmykids, still. Dierdre ishername,” Frank\nsaid, looking down.\nNow Ididn’t know thisguybefore tonight. ButIhave tosay,\nI’ve never seen anyone sodeferential toHowie before. And\nhe’s atough guy, Icanjusttell.Butaround Howie, he’s likea\npuppy.\n“Aw, Frankie, I knew that! I was just kidding you.”\nEveryone knew Howie wasn’t kidding. Though Idon’t know if\nhe really didn’t know her name and if Frank had married her.\nIfeltatthat moment that Frank could have flipped thetable\nover andstrangled Howie with hisbare hands. Ithink heactu-\nallyfeltcompromised. Theother guys were visibly uncomfort-\nable, too.And needless tosay, Iwanted tomake myself invis-\nible, soIfeigned coughing uncontrollably todeflect. Iblamed it\non the hot mustard.\nArt had the good sense to try to change the subject.\n“SoI’mthesecond-most famous oneatthetable tonight and\nno one’s even asked me about baseball, you sons of bitches!”\n“Jesus, Art,you’re right—I heard about that. Imeant toask\nyouearlier when youtoldthestory about thefirst time youleft\nNew York when theYankees sent yououttoKansas City in\n1960—what was that for again?” Mo asked.\nMocan’t seem tokeep any thoughts straight. Hehas a\nmemory like a trap, but he doesn’t seem to keep it together.\n92\n“Itwas where theYankees farm team was located before\nFindlay bought theAthletics—then aKCteam. Hewas pissy\nabout thetrades that made KClook likethefarm team after he\nbought them in’54,sotheYankees sent meandacouple other\nguys higher than metonegotiate with Findlay togetonemore\nround of young players. It’s where Maris came from.”\nThese guys were allbaseball fanatics. Me? Dodgers. Before\nthey even moved outtothecoast. Ihated theYankees andI\nstilldo.Butitwas asuccessful divergence away from what I\nhad hoped was Howard’s last flub inconversation. Iwas\nhumbled byArt’s position inmajor league baseball, soIhung\nontoevery word hesaid. Theguywasaveritable encyclopedia\nofstatistics, history andstrategy. Hewas fascinating tolisten\nto.It’sallheseemed totalkabout. Conversation inanyother\narea didn’t engage him, until Howie brought it home.\n“Sotoomany baseball trips foryour wife tohandle, huh,\nArt?” Howie said, with thatsame glimmer inhiseyeinstigating\na confrontation.\n“Yes, probably—“\n“Among other things?”\n“Sure. I don’t really have all the answers—“\n“Oh you probably do, Art—“\nI leaned over to Howie, “What are you doing?”\n“What about you, Howie? Where’s your wife?” Mosaid. Mo\nwas surprisingly affable. Myfirst impression ofhim was that\nhe’s agorilla andahustler, buthisknack fornuanced conver-\nsation struck measapleasant surprise. Hewasquite acharac-\nter.Hewas like alawyer—he would askquestions and lead\nconversations inadirection youdidn’t think itwassupposed to\ngo,andthen make youthink about what yousaid. Idon’t know\nif he did it intentionally but it was clearly a style of his lexicon.\n“Imean, weheard allabout your run-ins with dangerous wo-\nmen inHollywood! Soanyof‘emworth more than onefuck?”\nMo continued.\n“Yeah, doyouactually follow thegossip? Isthere anytruth to\nthat stuff ever?” Punch inquired.\n“I,uh,lived with oneforalong time. Sheleftright before I\ncame out here. She was alright—“\n“Until shestarted sleeping around!” Isaid, hoping tolighten\nthe tone. I didn’t anticipate Mo’s response.\n93\n“Soyounever settled down, huh? Acareer man through-and-\nthrough” he said.\n“Whaddya mean by that?” Howie said, unjustifiably\ndefensive.\n“Idon’t know about you, butI’veeaten enough Chinese to-\nnight to last me to next year—“ Frank said.\n“Remember that Chop Suey joint inConey Island weused to\nhang outat?” Punch said, relieving allthetension injustone\nsentence. Itseemed that bringing everyone back totheold\ndays was thecommon denominator, because they just had\nnothing to talk about of current.\n“Ohthat oldlady inthefront who yelled atuseach time we\ncame in?” Mo recalled.\n“She was a witch, just a witch,” Howie said.\n“She made great Mai Tai’s though—“ Punch said.\n“Did they even call them Mai Tai’s?” asked Frank.\n“You know Iused tomeet myguys there, itwas adropoff\njoint. Youknow, when Iwasworking atthecourts downtown,”\nMo said.\n“Really? I thought it was here in Chinatown—“ Frank said.\n“Nah, wealways met outintheboroughs. Itwas apain to\ngetoutthere, youknow, courthouse atFoley Square—“ Mo\nsaid, butthen hesitated and looked atFrank. “How didyou\nknow about Chinatown?”\nFrank then hesitated.\n“You just said it—it’s right here, by the courthouse.”\n“Yeah, because that’s what theFeds thought, too, sothey\nbugged every place around here,” Moresponded, with alittle\ntoo much irony in his tone.\nFrank shrugged andtook adrink. Everyone seemed toknow\nwhat Mowas getting at.Howie told meabout Frank andMo,\nsoatleast Ihadalittle background onthem, though Iplayed\ndumb.\nArtcontinued talking about baseball, andthe1961 Yankees,\nbut Mo wouldn’t drop it.\n“Igotta askyou, Frank, after allthese years—who thefuck\ndidyoutipoff?Imean, youhadtobeplaying both sides orelse\nyou’d be dead or in Ossining. I’ve always wondered—“\n“Jesus, Mo,it’sbeen 30some-odd years andyou’re stillstuck\non this?” was Frank’s only answer.\n94\n“He didtime, Frank,” Howie said matter offactly, “He did\ntime for you—“\nFrank looked atHowie with astunned expression, worse\nthan the one before.\n“It’s notlikehewasexactly innocent inthisdeal, youknow,”\nhesaid toHowie, then turned toMo,“Imean, youwere steal-\ning information and selling it to the Mob—“ Frank said.\n“Yeah andyouwere telling them andtheFeds Iwasdoing it,\nyou sonofabitch—“ Mo growled as he stood up.\n“Hey, hey, let’s take iteasy, eh?We’ve been having such a\ngood night—“ Punch said in vain.\n“Idon’t need this, Ireally don’t need this shit anymore,”\nHowie said quietly and got up from the table.\nHestepped around Mo,andpatted Punch ontheshoulder as\nhe walked out of the restaurant.\n“Mo, youcan’t believe Iwastalking totheFeds about you. I\ndidn’t know itwasyou. Ihadnoidea youwere involved,” Frank\nsaid apologetically. Hewas defensive nomore, butMohad\nalready turned away. Heshook hands with Artand leaned\ndown to hug Punch.\n“Gentlemen, it’sreally been awonderful evening, I—uh,\ngoodbye” Isaid feebly, having noidea how tomake anexit\nwithout the painful awkwardness of the situation.\nIstepped outoftherestaurant andthankfully ithadstopped\nraining, buttheairwas cold. Ilooked upanddown thestreet\nforHoward butcouldn’t locate him. Ifigured he’d headed toa\nbar. Ifitwasn’t solate, Icould imagine himheading straight\nfortheairport togetback toL.A., thewaythings went tonight.\nThough they were allinteresting characters, there was no\nstory there, atleast from what Ithought Howard’s perspective\nwas on the night.\nSure enough, Icaught aglimpse ofHowie sitting atabarina\nrestaurant down afewstairs. Theplace looked likeitwasthere\n100 years and it smelled like whiskey and spare ribs.\n“What the fuck just happened in there?” I asked.\n“Didn’t take you long to find me.”\n“Listen don’t play games with me,youoldshit. Youdrag me\nouthere forthis tonight? What thefuck areyouthinking? I\nhave aroster ofclients who actually need metodowhat I’m\npaid to do—I’m not your fucking sidekick.”\n95\n“Oh yeah? Youseemed toenjoy yourself with those clowns.\nI’mpinning alotonthis, youknow, andIcanmake ithappen,\nbut not if you’re working against me.”\n“Idon’t know what you’re talking about. There’s nostory\nthere. Unless these guys areinspiring fictional characters for\nyouandallofasudden youknow how towrite acoherent story\nwith anarc, you’ll bepushing aboulder upamountain ifyou\ntrytowrite something—not tomention they’ll probably have\nyou killed if you piss any one of them off.”\n“They’re harmless. They’re old, has-been tough guys who\nhaven’t done anything with their lives since high school. They\nwere from the gutter then, and they are from the gutter now.”\n“Really? Because Idon’t know where thefuck youwere for\nthepast four hours, butIwas sitting inarestaurant with the\nnext commissioner ofbaseball andthree other guys who scare\nthe hell out of me.”\nIordered adrink and wesattogether silently forseveral\nminutes atthisawful, stinking barthat Iwouldn’t becaught\ndead at if it was in L.A.\n“Doweneed totalkabout thisright now? Ijustneed toknow\nyou’re with me.”\n“I’m with you. I’malways with you. ButIhave tosay, ifyou\ngothrough with thisscreenplay thing, you’ll have toconvince\nmemuch better than youdidtonight that thisisadecision that\nwillbenefit you, other than going through afutile andpainful\nexercise.”\nHoward looked intohisdrink. Icould seehiswalls were go-\ningup.Ihadn’t seen that look inhimsince before thelasttime\nhe went into rehab years ago.\n“What areyougoing todo?” Iasked, notspecifying fora\nreason.\n“Idon’t know. Imay lease aplace down here. May goback to\nL.A. I don’t know.”\n“Ok, butImeant tonight,” which Ireally didn’t, butIwas\nhoping togetthrough tohimsomehow. “You going back toJer-\nsey? That a little weird now?”\nHe didn’t answer.\nIfinished mydrink andithadstarted todrizzle again out-\nside. Irealized that notonly wasmyumbrella back attheDuck\nHouse, butthat mysuitcase was, too.Itwas lateandIdidn’t\n96\nthink theplace would still beopen and Ipanicked. Ijogged\ndown thestreet intherain back totherestaurant. Thelights\noutfront weren’t on,butthefront door wasstillopen soIwent\ninside hoping Icould justgrab mystuff andgo.Theheadwaiter\nwas there andremembered meandmybag, sohetold meto\nwait justaminute while hegotthekeys from themanager to\nunlock theback closet where they hadputit.Ipeered around\nthebarandsawthatthetable wewere atearlier wasn’t empty.\nI stayed out of site to try to hear what was being said.\n“Idunno, Imean, itwas along night butwhat dowereally\nknow about theguyatthispoint? Willsheeven have enough to\ngoon?” Ithink that wasArt,whose voice wasrecognizable be-\ncause hewastheonly oneofthebunch without aterribly thick\nBrooklyn accent.\n“She’s good, Ipromise you, she’s very good. Investigative,\nI’mnotsure you—us—are theonly sources she’ll have,” said\nPunch, whom Icould seeinthereflection ofthemirror onthe\nwall.\n“Itrust that, sure, she’s really gotittogether andI’veread\nsome of her other pieces,” Art said.\n“Look, ifshe’s notcareful, shecould beinalotoftrouble,”\nand that was most definitely Mo.\n“What the hell do you mean by that?” asked Punch.\nThese guys really don’t trust each other, I thought.\n“No what Imean is,sheputs anarticle outthere, good or\nbadorotherwise, andthisguyhasanarmy ofPRpeople, they\ncould crush herandthemagazine thisthing isprinted in,”Mo\nclarified.\n“Mo, you’re absolutely right. Ideal with thepress allthe\ntime, andthePRpeople that theplayers hire. They aresharks.\nIt’sagame tothem,” Artsaid, slamming hislarge hand down\non the table.\n“She’s abiggirl, shecanhandle it.Ifit’snotagood piece,\nher editor won’t let it out,” said Punch.\n“What anight. IfIdidn’t sayitearlier, I’mreally glad weput\nthistogether, despite everything. Mo,I’msorry about youand\nFrank,” Art said.\n“Eh, look, Idon’t care how many years it’sbeen, ifIcould go\nback andundo whatever Icould totake away those years in\nprison, Iwould. Tohear itfrom Frank’s mouth that he\n97\ninformed theFeds, Imean, Iknew itallalong, buthesaid it.\nIt’sheartbreaking, really,” Mosaid. “But listen, I’mglad we\ngottogether, too, solet’s stay intouch. Punch, Ithink what\nyour kidisdoing isgreat andIwish herthebest ofluck. Ihope\nshe gets the thing published everywhere. Good for her.”\n98\nChapter 19Howard's Honeymoon Is Over\nMeanwhile, Howard’s bottomless drink attheseedy barinCh-\ninatown finally came toanendandhehadthem callacarser-\nvice forhim. Hegotinthebackseat oftheTowncar anddidn’t\nrespond when thedriver asked himwhere hisdestination was.\nHeleaned forward and said, “Ihave nowhere togo.Ihave\nnowhere togo.Justdrive around foralittle while, we’ll figure\nit out.”\nWhen thedriver turned around tokick himoutofhiscar,he\nrecognized him. Heputthecarindrive andproceeded todrive\naround Manhattan. Howard eventually passed outintheback\nseat, though, andthedriver wasgiven nodirections. Hecalled\nhisdispatcher totellhimhehadHoward Kessler intheback of\nhiscarpassed outat1:30am. This wasn’t L.A. Nooneknew\nwho hisagent was, noonewas calling hispublicist tocome\npick him upand gethim outofthepress’ way. This was a\nQueens-based carservice with mostly Dominican immigrant\ndrivers who didn’t particularly care about Howard Kessler’s\nVIP status. They wanted the fare, and didn’t want any trouble.\n“Well Idon’t have nofucking idea what todowith thisfuck-\ningguy, Jose, Idon’t know why youfucking callme,” said Na-\nheem, thedispatcher forCitySite CarService. “Why don’t you\njustdrop himoutthefucking car,man, andyoucanbeatyour\nnext pickup early, for the clubs.”\n“That ain’t going towork, man, thisisacelebrity, Ican’t just\ndrop him out. Plus Ibeen driving forhalf anhour and the\ntank’s half-full. This guygotmillions ofdollars, andIain’t go-\ningtoberesponsible forit,man, Naheem, youhear me?” Jose\nsaid assertively.\n“Just take himtoahotel then, andletthem handle it.Gethis\ncredit card number,” Naheem said.\n99\n“Which hotel?”\n“Take himtothefucking Soho Grand orsomething likethat.\nYou’re down there now, right? Fucking Jose, man, why youget\nthese crazy motherfuckers all the time, man?”\nJose drove afewblocks west tothehotel Naheem mentioned.\nHeprayed they would have room forhim, oratleast know\nwhat todoforhim. Hepulled upinfront ofadoorman who\nscowled athim. Heputthecarinpark andgotouttospeak to\nthe doorman.\n“YoIgotHoward Kessler intheback ofmycar, man. You\ngotta help me.He’s passed outdrunk, orsomething. Ain’t mak-\ningnosense. Idon’t know where hestaying orwhere helive, I\ngot no idea,” Jose pleaded to the doorman.\n“He got bags with him?” he asked.\n“No, man, nothing. He ain’t got nothing with him.”\n“Where’d you pick him up? Anyone with him?”\n“We gotthecallfrom anasty barorrestaurant inChinatown.\nHecome stumbling outtheplace hanging ontoanoldChinese\nguy who push him in my car. And that’s all. I got nothing else.”\n“Hold onaminute, lemme seewhat wecando.Stay here,\nman,” thedoorman said, who had perked upand was inter-\nested inhelping ifonly because ofthemarquee name slumped\nover in the back seat.\nJose litacigarette andpaced under theoverhang infront of\nthehotel tostay outofthedrizzle. Thedoorman came back a\nfew minutes later with ayoung woman inablack suit and\nstilettos, holding aphone/ organizer into which shewas typing\nfuriously.\nSheleaned over topeer intotheback seat andputthephone\ntoherear. Emotionless and speaking inhushed tones, she\nended hercallandtyped more into thedevice. The doorman\nstood like awatchguard over thecarwhile Jose paced and\nsmoked likeafirst-time father inthematernity ward awaiting\nnews of the new arrival.\nShe disappeared into thehotel again and came outafew\nminutes later with aman inasuit who also peered into the\nback seat ofthecar.They stepped back under theheat lamps\nandconferred forafewminutes. They each gotontheir cell-\nphones. Sheended hercallandwalked back intothehotel. He\nended his call and walked over to the doorman.\n100\n“Take himinside, buttellthedriver togototheback deliv-\neryentrance inthe2nd bay. Stay with him, don’ ttake your\neyes offthisguyuntil youdrop himinroom 1545 andclose the\ndoor behind you. Above all, make sure no one is following you.”\nThedoorman conveyed thistothedriver who quickly jumped\nin the car, with the doorman, and sped around the corner.\nItturns outthewoman inthesuitisthehotel’s VIPconcierge\nwho knows every publicist and agent who isimportant. She\nwas able tolocate andspeak tooneofHoward’s publicists in\nL.A. who had been seeking Howard’s location fornearly 2\nmonths since his disappearance from L.A.\nAnd like that, Howard’s honeymoon was over.\n101\nChapter 20Frank\n“Honey, that you?” Dee said.\n“Why are you up? It’s 2am.”\n“Why are you so late? Everything ok? You have fun?”\n“That was three questions with three distinctly different an-\nswers. What do you want to know?”\n“Well that answered oneofthequestions. Byyoustanding\nhere and giving meattitude inthe middle ofthe night\nanswered theother. And bythispoint Ireally don’t care why\nyou’re late, so I guess we’re done.”\n“I’m sorry. Itwas ashitty night. Imean, itstarted good.\nHowie showed upandthat was great. Imean, theguyhasn’t\nchanged—“ Irealized asIspoke, right inmid-sentence, that all\nthememories Ihad retained purposefully were good ones. A\nhealthy choice, Ithink. But instating that Howie hasn’t\nchanged, Iexperienced aflood ofnot sogreat memories\ntriggered by his instigating tonight.\nIstopped foramoment andthought about those memories.\nWhy was I only holding on to the good ones?\n“How do you mean?” Dee asked, I suspect not-so-innocently.\n“He’s aninstigator. Helikes seeing people goatit.Like he\ngoes forthejugular every time. Noonecanhave aconversa-\ntionaround himwithout himturning everything around tothe\nnegative. I’m not saying it right. I’m tired.”\n“You’re just figuring this outnow? Jesus, Frank, Icouldn’t\nstand theguywhen wewere inhigh school forthat reason.\nWhy would youthink that 50years ofcocaine, Hollywood, and\nfamous people would turn himintoapussycat?” Deesaid, asif\nshewas finally saying what shewanted towhen wewere 17\nyears old.\n102\n“Mo was there and that didn’t gowell, either. That’s what\nbasically ended thenight. The guyisstillhotabout theD.A.\nstuff.”\n“You didn’t tellmeMowould bethere—that wastobeexpec-\nted, you know,” she said.\n“Ididn’t know hewould show up.He’s been likeaghost for\nyears.”\nThenight leftabadtaste inmymouth. Seeing theother guys\nwas nice. It’ssadabout Punch; Ialways liked himalotandit\nseems likehe’s justhadsomany health problems. And hewas\nthemost athletic and inthebest shape outofallofus.He\ncould have played basketball forBrooklyn College, but he\nchose toleave andgotocollege faraway. Idon’t even know\nwhere hedisappeared to.And Ienjoyed talking toArtabout\nbaseball. Iknew about him; hisname isoccasionally inthe\nsports pages. ThelastIsaw Artwas when hewalked into the\nclub room lateonenight, andIwas inthere with agirl. Ihad\nheruponthetable inavery compromising position andshe\ndidn’t seeArtwalk in.Hestood there forasecond andlooked\natme,andthen turned andslowly walked outoftheroom. I\nheard himlock thedoor behind him. Inever bothered going to\nthereunions after—I knew who Iwanted tostay intouch with\nand if we couldn’t, then it was fate. Life goes on.\nWewoke upinthemorning tomydaughter banging onthe\nbedroom door yelling about someone at the door.\nIt turned out to be Punch’s daughter, Jessica, the writer.\nShe had good timing, since Iwas just inthemood totalk\nabout Howie.\n“Sowhat happened lastnight? Ican’t getthewords outof\nmydad, who pretty much organized everything—nothing dra-\nmatic, I hope?” she asked sincerely.\nIpoured usboth some coffee andsatherdown atthebreak-\nfasttable offthekitchen. Istared outthekitchen window, my\nrobe hanging drably, andtried tofigure italloutbefore Isaid\nanything.\nDee came down and introduced herself tothegirl. She\ntouched herhair and complemented thecoloring. Only Dee\ncould getaway with that. Total strangers, shetouches their\nhair.\n103\n“Frank, youcan’t putclothes on?Look atyou, youlook likea\nhobo, we have a guest.”\nJessica laughed and tried to cover it unsuccessfully.\n“I’lltellyouwhat happened. Howie came back andstirred up\nshit, ashealways had, and then satback and watched the\nstorm.”\nI looked at Dee who stared at me like I grew ten heads.\n“It’s true, Dee, Imean, Ilove theguy, andI’veadmired him\ninthemovies andstuff over theyears, butspending lastnight\nwith himjustreminded meofalltheresentment Ihad. Theoth-\nerguys, too,probably, though Idon’t really know that anyone\nelse had the friendship I had with Howie back then.”\n“Soyou’re saying thatHowie mistreated hisfriends byinstig-\nating arguments or by exploiting fissures?” Jessica asked.\n“Whatever you said it probably is right. I don’t know.”\nWespoke forabout acouple ofhours. Ididmore re-thinking\nthan Ididrecounting, soI’mnotsure how helpful itwastoJes-\nsica who iswriting astory about ourrelationships askids, I\nthink, related to Howie.\n“Sounds difficult. Butit’sover now, right? Orareyouseeing\nhim again?”\n“Idon’t know. Weallexchanged information. Idon’t know\nwhat’s next, ifanything. Igotmyown problems, you know\nwhat Imean?” Isaid, halfhoping that thewhole episode was\nbehind us.“Idon’t even know what youhave towrite about,\nbut—“\n“OhIhave plenty towrite about, don’t youworry about that,\nyou’ve been very helpful,” she said.\n“You’re notturning thisintosomething ugly, areyou?” Isaid\nafter I thought about what she just said.\n“I’m justdocumenting what things were years agoaccording\ntoyour collective memories, and then anaccount ofHoward\nKessler’s re-emergence inyour lives, ifeven forafewshort\nhours.”\nItsounded legit, soIgave hermyblessing andwent back to\nbed.\n* * * * * *\nA few days later my cell rings, it was pretty late.\nIt was Howie asking to get together to talk.\n104\nBecause Iwasoverwhelmed Iguess from hearing from him, I\nagreed to meet.\nSohecomes bythefollowing afternoon when thehouse was\nempty, oddly. Ididn’t know forhow long myparasitic kids\nwould beoutofthehouse andInever know where mywife is,\nbutatleast wecould have some peace together. Maybe Icould\ngetmyhead straight about allthis. I’mconfused andIdon’t\nthink youcanblame meforthat. Ifeelbetrayed inaway, butI\ncan’t putmyfinger onwhat, since itwas myown memories\nthat betrayed me,notHowie. SoItried nottobemad athim. I\nhad tobehonest—I didn’t even know theguy. Imean, he’s\ntalking atthedinner about yoga andtraveling toIndia andhav-\ningdinner with Sylvester Stallone. What dowehave incom-\nmon anymore? I’ve been laying bricks and contracting con-\nstruction mywhole life,surrounded bypeople from Brooklyn.\nHowie? He’s been living inadifferent world, with different\nthings, adifferent perspective, anddifferent people. Ican’t put\nmyfinger onit;Ijustdon’t know how toarticulate how strange\nit is to revisit this part of my life.\nIhad been hanging ontoamemory ofHowie since grade\nschool. When inallhonesty, theguyhasbeen anasshole tome,\nmyfriends, andmost ofall,mywife. Even back then. Idon’t\nknow who I was kidding.\nIt’sallvery disorienting, really. Ispend mylifelooking upto\nhim. Now, allofasudden, over some fried rice andmoo shu\npork, Irealize that myidol, myoldest friend, mychildhood\nfriend, is a selfish asshole and I never meant a thing to him?\nItcan’t betrue. Ihave tobeexperiencing some sort oflate\nmidlife crisis.\n* * * * * * *\nTheleaves were wetandthey hadn’t come toscoop them up\nfrom thestreet yet.With lastnight’s wind andtoday’s rain, the\nstreets were amess. Icould hear skidding upanddown thehill\nallmorning. Soit’snowonder that Howie, who’s been living in\nrainless California foryears, hasnoidea how todrive inthis\nweather.\nIwas sitting inthefront room reading Newsday when I\nheard thethud oftwocars colliding. There was noscreech of\nbrakes, justthethud. Ipeered outthefront window andsaw\ntwoguys arguing standing outintherain. One carwasalarge,\n105\nblack Escalade andtheother was atricked-out late-model Ac-\ncord. Itried toseeifIknew anyone, butneither carrang abell\nto me. I sat back down and continued reading for a moment.\nIstood uptolook outthewindow once more and sure\nenough, itwas Howie. Ihesitated forasecond before putting\nmyshoes onandgrabbing anumbrella, justtoseehiminteract\nwith thelittle thug whose carhepunished. Irandown the\ndriveway andover totheaccident. There wasplenty ofbroken\nglass andugly dents, butnothing serious, since both guys had\ntheenergy tostand toetotoeshouting ateach other. Bythis\ntime afewother cars were stopped and everyone had their\ncellphones out. They recognized Howie.\nThis couldn’t be good.\nItried tointervene, butIdon’t exactly have thebest temper,\neither. Itried topullthekidaway from Howie anddotheold\n“doyouknow who thisguyis”routine, buthewasn’t from this\nneighborhood andwasalready defensive. Plus Ididn’t know if\nhe had a gun on him.\nItried then togetHowie toback down. Though hewasmore\nobliging, Ithink itmay actually have been thekid’s fault, with\nthedirection ofthecar,helooked tobespeeding down thehill\nand Howie was coming up.Either way, neither was backing\ndown. People started tocrowd around atthispoint despite the\nrain and they were taking pictures ofHowie and this whole\nscene. ItoldHowie heshould justplay down who heis,Ithink\nthekidwas sohepped uponadrenaline that hedidn’t recog-\nnize him, andthatheshould throw acouple hundred bucks and\nwalk away.\nThenext thing Iknow, fists areflying andthree other people\nareinthemix. Innotime flat, thekidwas ontheground,\nbloody nose dripping down into themess offlattened leaves,\nleaking oil,andrain. Howie takes outawad ofcash from his\npocket and throws itatthekidontheground, gets into his\ntruck, anddrives itupmydriveway. Hetold metoclose the\ngate. Ithink hefinally realized thesizeofthecrowd around the\nscene and the implications of cellphone cameras.\nWe walked inside and heard the police siren.\n“Oh, come one, Ididn’t hurt that kid,Ijustknocked him a\nlittle. He threw the first punch.”\n106\n“He’s ablack kid, Howie, and this isBay Ridge. What the\nfuck do you think people are going to make of this?”\n“Jesus, itwas just alittle fender bender and thekidwas\nshooting down thehillanddidn’t stop orstay onhisside ofthe\nroad.”\n“I hear you. It still don’t look good,” I said.\n“Eh, let’s wait and see. I didn’t get you in any trouble, did I?”\nIwasn’t sure hemeant that, butIrealized Icouldn’t besus-\npicious ofeverything hesaid. Iwas already being more stan-\ndoffish than Iwanted tobe.Iwanted tokeep more ofanopen\nmind today.\n“Sowhat’s onyour mind?” Iasked, pretending nottohear\nthecommotion outside since Ireally wanted togettothebot-\ntom ofthings with Howie and getsome closure, asmywife\ncalls it.\n“Icame back here, youknow, to,uh,tofind outwhat I’ve\nbeen missing allthese years. I’mlooking around atyour house,\nandpictures ofyouandyour kids andstuff andit’ssomething I\ndon’t have—“\n“Oh, shit, Howie, youcantake myfucking kids. Idon’t know\nwhat happened, but these kids—“\n“Nah, Idon’t mean that—I mean, thelife. Your life. You\nworked hard, you bought this house, you goonvacations,\nit’s—I can’t explain it. I don’t know—“\nIhadnoidea what hewastalking about. Ididn’t know what\ntosayinresponse. Even with suspicion, Icouldn’t figure out\nwhat his motivation was.\n“I’m attheendofmycareer, Frank. I’mnotgoing toactany-\nmore. I need something to do.”\n“Why don’t youjustrelax? Don’t youhave ahouse inItaly\nand Hawaii orsomething? You don’t want towork anymore,\njust enjoy yourself.”\nI could have been talking to a stranger. I had no connection.\n“Nah, Ijust—I don’t know. Listen, it’sgreat toseeyou. It\nreally is. I can’t believe how many years it’s been—“\nThere was afewloud knocks atthedoor. Ithadtobecops.\nThey never usethefucking doorbell. They always bang theshit\nout of your door.\n107\nHowie andIlooked ateach other. Webroke uplaughing. He\nslapped myknee andwejoked about how it’sliketheolddays\nagain.\n* * * * * * *\nThe cops leftafter they saw that itwas Howard Kessler; it\nwasnothing tobeconcerned about. Iwould have blown agas-\nketifIhad anEscalade with adent onitlikehedid, butit\ndidn’t seem toconcern himabit.Hisphone kept ringing, buzz-\ning, beeping fortheafternoon. Hedidn’t flinch orpick itup\nonce. I finally asked him about it.\n“Who thefuck keeps calling you? Should youanswer oneof\nthese calls?”\n“The press, Hollywood, the world, everyone knows I’m here.”\n“HERE? Here?” Igot alittle nervous. I’m not exactly\nsomeone who wants toomuch attention, after myrun-in years\nago.\n“No, well bynow probably, yes—“ hemotioned outthewin-\ndow where thecrowd ofpeople standing intherainoutside the\ngate attheend ofmydriveway seemed tobecamped out,\n“They know I’m in New York.”\n“Is that bad?”\n“Iwanted some time alone, with youguys, away from the\ncrazies, youknow. Iwant towrite—“ hehesitated, asifhelet\nsomething slipthat heshouldn’t have. Icouldn’t pick upwhat\nit was.\n“That’s understandable. Why can’t celebrities just dowhat\nthey want, sometimes?” Irealized what Isaid was alittle stu-\npid, so I kept my mouth shut.\nHoward told meabout theincident atthehotel inSoho the\nother night.\n“And theworst part ofitis,mygoddamned agent, Alan, was\nin town—you know, you met him, at the Duck House—“\n“Right, I remember the guy. Seems like a good guy—“\n“Yeah, he’s been protecting memywhole career. The one\nnight Ireally needed someone, Ifuck up.It’llbeoutonthe\nnews soon enough.”\n“Why wasn’t he around?”\n“I don’t know. I don’t know. Probably my fault.”\nIcould seeHowie wasn’t talking tomeatthispoint, hewas\ntalking tohimself. Ididn’t really care toomuch either way.\n108\nSomehow, theconversation always went back tohim. Notthat\nthere was much Iwanted totalk about, butthere areother\nthings intheworld besides him. Apparently heisn’t aware of\nthat.\nWecalled itadayonce myfatdaughter came home from\nwork andstarted jumping when shesawHowie onthecouch. I\ntold hernottocallherfriends, butthese kids areaddicted to\ntheir cellphones.\nWedidn’t really discuss much. Howie asked meafewques-\ntions about mylife,general stuff. Idon’t have anything tohide.\nThings have been tough. Thework, theindictments, thekids,\ngoing straight andnarrow—tough forkeeping thisfamily busi-\nness afloat.\nAnd that was it. Never saw Howie again.\n109\nChapter 21\nAlan feltataponhisshoulder andwassostartled heknocked\naglass over onthetable hewasleaning ontoeavesdrop onthe\nothers. Itwas theheadwaiter returning with hisbag. Butthe\ncommotion caused theguys tolook back atthebar. Alan tried\ntohide behind thecurtain andmotioned totheheadwaiter not\ntosayanything—they locked gazes foramoment until itap-\npeared that the guys weren’t investigating the eavesdropping.\nAlan feltlikethemoment hadpassed andthat hewas safe.\nHethought itseemed legitimate enough that theheadwaiter\nhaddropped theglass. What hedidn’t realize was themirror\nbehind thebarreflecting himinplain view toMo, Punch and\nArt.Alan scrambled outoftherestaurant with hissuitcase. He\nchecked hiswatch toseehow many hours itwould bebefore\nhecould jump aflight back toL.A., butitwas only 1am now\nandhecouldn’t leave forseveral more hours. Hehopped ina\ncabtohishotel inmidtown. Holding hishead inhishands, he\ntried tostraighten outwhat hehadwitnessed during thewhole\nevening.\nHestepped intohisroom, dropped hisbagonthebed, closed\nthecurtains andopened twotepid mini bottles ofvodka, down-\ningthem inthehopes offalling asleep, aiming tosort outhis\nthoughts inthemorning. Helayback onthebed, hewastired.\nButtoomuch hadgone onthisevening. Hehadakidincollege\nandtwin two-year oldgrandkids. Hewanted them alltohave\nmore than heever did,sohehadtokeep working with aseries\nofsuccessful representations before hehung itup.Hewasn’t\nprepared toendthings onasour note right now, after Howie’s\nburnout over thepast fewmonths. Hecould already sense that\nhisMidas touch wasn’t aseffective asitonce was—waiting\nlonger fortables, didn’t gethisseason tickets totheLakers\nthrough thestudio this year, having toleave messages. He\n110\nnever hadtoleave amessage before—the studio execs always\ntook his calls.\nHehad been inHollywood—on the insider’s inside cir-\ncuit—and knew what happens toagents, and stars once the\ngloss starts tofade. Hesaw thetelltale signs ofitinhisown\ncareer—facts that hewasdenying formonths now. This tripto\nNew York was probably thestrongest wake-up callhecould\nhave had, before the shit really hit the fan.\nAlan faced hischoices andrealized that perhaps heshould\nbedistancing himself from Howard. Heretraced thesteps over\nthepast twoyears andfrom aslightly different perspective, it\nappeared that Howard’s downfall truly began back then, and\nthat Alan’s actions tokeep Howard artificially afloat probably\njustprolonged theinevitable endofaHollywood star’s career.\nAlan was hanging on for dear life.\nOntheflight back toL.A. Alan was glad nottorun into\nsomeone heknew. Alltoooften onthecross-country flights\nthere issomeone hegets stuck talking toabout thebusiness.\nWhy couldn’t someone talkbaseball? Orpolitics, even? It’sal-\nways deals, deals, andgossip. Today was aclear dayandno\nonewasaround. Hewasseated next toayoung woman with a\nlaptop who was typing furiously andotherwise quietly kept to\nherself. Thelastthing Alan needed wasawannabe writer bug-\nging him for representation.\nWhen thedrinks cart sped by,Alan thoughtfully tapped his\nneighbor ontheshoulder since herheadphones most likely\nfiltered out the clinging and clattering of the cart.\n“You want, anything, honey?” he asked.\n“Oh, wow, thank yousomuch forpoking me.I’minmyown\nworld over here—isn’t that thestewardess’ jobthough?” and\nthey both laughed.\n“What are you writing, if I may ask? You are so intense!”\n“It’s apiece about mydad’s friends andacelebrity—I’m just\ntranscribing some interviews now soI’mnotwriting anything\nyet.It’ssofrustrating. You justcan’t find anaffordable tran-\nscription service outthere with quick turnaround soIusually\njust do it myself.”\n“Ididn’t even know that was stillaproblem! Years agowe\nhad dictation machines, and every office had apool of\n111\nsecretaries who were experts indictation. You don’t seethat\nanymore.”\n“Oh mygod, Icouldn’t imagine. That’s asight right outof\nMad Men.”\n“Don’t get me started on that!”\nShe looked athim quizzically. Most people Alan talks to\nalready know who heis;herealized hehadn’t made anintro-\nduction yet.\n“I’m sorry, that made nosense. Irepresent thewriters for\nthe show—they’re nearly all women—“\n“Really? How interesting. Isuppose youcan’t really getaway\nwith making ashow likethat with male writers. Idon’t know\nmuch about theentertainment writing world. I’majournal-\nist—you know how we’re like oil and water!”\n“So what celebrity is your piece about?”\n“Um, I’mtrying tokeep itunder wraps, atleast until mycon-\ntract comes through onitandIgetmore thoughts down onpa-\nper—I’m not trying to be—“\n“No ofcourse—I totally understand. Listen, I’minthebusi-\nness oftelling people that Ican’t tellthem things, sothat’s\nfine!”\n“So you are a lawyer?”\n“No, notatall.I’managent, amanager, foractors andfew\nscreenwriters.”\n“Like Ari Gold in Entourage?”\n“Yes, but25years older and with much less energy and a\nsmaller office.”\n“What an interesting line of work—“\nI could see her mind connecting dots and I wanted to deflect.\n“So what other pieces have you written?”\n“Oh, I’msure it’snothing you’ve heard oforseen. Icontrib-\nutetoNPR soIgooutonreports anddopainless exposes like\nwoodcarving communes inWyoming, girls’ education inCam-\nbodia, thepeople who fixroad sign overhangs oninterstates,\nthatkind ofthing. I’vehadpieces published recently intheSan\nJose Mercury News andinthenow-defunct New Jersey section\nof the New York Times. My big claims to fame.”\n“That’s great, very good publications. Mywife listens to\nNPR.” Notreally, butIthought that itwould benice toshow\n112\nsome level ofinterest inher work. She was noslouch,\nobviously.\nAcouple ofhours later Iwoke from ashort doze andshewas\nasleep. Herhand wasstillonherkeyboard soherscreensaver\nhadn’t come on. Icouldn’t help but glimpse atthe\ntranscription.\nIcouldn’t believe what Isaw. Ihad togetupand walk\naround, biting myfist,because Icould notbelieve theodds of\nsitting next tothedaughter ofHowie’s oldest friend. Shewas\ntheonewriting thearticle that Ioverheard theguys talking\nabout. I absolutely couldn’t get over the obscene coincidence.\nIread alittle bitoftheinterview with Mo.Ileaned over abit\ntoscroll down, hoping togod shedidn’t wake up.I’mnota\nsmall man, sotheleaning over part without nudging herwas\npainfully difficult. Mycuriosity gotthebest ofmeandIhadto\nread more. Itwas fascinating, what they were saying about\nHowie. My Howie.\nIdecided nottopush myluck anyfurther andIcutitout. I\ngotuponce more andpaced upanddown theaisle alittle. I\nnoticed herstirring andsoIrushed back totheseat. Iplunked\ndown hoping to rouse her a bit, and I was successful.\n“Oh, I’m so sorry, did I wake you? I—“\n“No, not at all, I’m just a little hazy. I’m up.”\nSheslugged from abottle ofwater inherbag, squirted some\nPurell inherhands, ranherfingers through herhairandsatup\nstraight and peeked out the window.\n“Still clouds,” she said.\n“Are youheaded outtoL.A.forbusiness?” Iasked, hoping to\nre-start our conversation about the article.\n“No, it’safriend’s wedding this weekend and I’minthe\nbridal party soIhadtogooutadaybefore. There have been\n700 fittings for this dress and it’s still awful.”\n“You should take some meetings, foryour article, while\nyou’re there.”\n“Yeah, Iprobably won’t have time. That’s nottrue. Iwillhave\ntime, Ijustdon’t know anyone. Idohave aproposal inatHello\nmagazine and they’ve expressed alotofinterest, and that’s\nprobably mybest shot forthispiece. I’msupposed tomeet with\nthem on Monday first thing.”\n113\nIcouldn’t wait toseetheinformation shehad. Shementioned\nearlier that there was nearly 40hours ofinterviews. Who the\nfuck was sheinterviewing? Didthose four oldguys have that\nmuch on Howie?\nMyheart started pounding asshecontinued herresponse. I\nstilldon’t know where Istand with Howie, butafter somany\nyears, Iwant toprotect him. Ican’t stop herfrom writing the\narticle—and Idon’t; clearly she’s talented, connected, andhas\nthe information already. I want the tapes.\n“Afriend suggested querying theeditors atPeople, Us,anda\ncouple others andHello wastheonly onetogetback tome.No\noneresponded when Isent toGQandEsquire, which Ithought\nwould beshoo-ins. Tough business. SoIjusthave togetsome\nmore down onpaper, likeIwassaying earlier, before they con-\ntract me for it.”\n“Isee.Sounds liketheright mixofpublications. Doyouhave\nan agent?”\n“Me? No.Idon’t—uh, never thought about it.Imean, freel-\nance journalism iswhat itis.Noagent would spend asecond\nconsidering me!Idon’t write fiction. Idopieces forPBS affili-\nates and NPR, and that’s my sweet spot.”\n“Idon’t know anything about thepiece you’re writing, butif\nit’s anything better than Access Hollywood, and it’s\ntrue—that’s thekey, ifit’strue andyoucanback itup—then\nyoumight want tooption it.Anagent could also getyouintoa\npublication like Vanity Fair, which holds, you know, alittle\nmore cache than Hello.”\n“I don’t know what option means.”\n“Optioning itmeans that youhave anentertainment lawyer,\nagent, andmanager shop ittostudios toseeifthey’re inter-\nested inpaying you forthestory, and they develop it—or\nnot—but yougetpaid either way, ifyour lawyer structures the\nagreement well!”\n“That’s justoutofmyleague. Imean, Ihaven’t even thought\nabout it—gosh, it’sanother world. What doyoumean—like de-\nvelop—a movie?”\n“Itcould be.Youwouldn’t believe where producers gettheir\nideas forcommercials, TVsitcoms, series, movies, shorts, com-\nics,web series, there aretons ofways togetcontent outthere.\nIfit’syour idea, though, youhave toclaim itearly onandshop\n114\nittotheright places sothey won’t sitonitjusttolock outoth-\ner competitors from developing it.”\n“Then what happens? Imean, why nottake themoney and\nrun?”\n“There aresyndication rights tobenegotiated, spin offs, se-\nquels, orscripts youmay want todevelop yourself, asawriter,\nso you want to keep your hand in the game.”\nIstopped foramoment realizing that herhead wasspinning.\nShewasasmart kid,Icould tell,andappeared tobeweighing\nwhat Iwas saying literally andseriously. That, tome,meant\nshe had something.\n“Here’s mycard. Iwant youtocallmethenext couple of\ndays, orwhenever yougoback home, todiscuss what youwant\nto do with this story.”\nIlooked atthetapes; they were sitting right there inherun-\nzipped bag. Shegotuptogototherestroom right before we\nlanded. Icould reach down into thelaptop bagandgrab the\ntapes. Icould have made aterrible decision, butIdidn’t. Ileft\nthem there, like a civilized person.\n“Ihave stuff allweekend with thewedding and everything\nbutI’llcallyouwhen Ihave hadsome time tothink about this.\nIhave averbal with Hello andthey seemed really excited about\nit,butyou’re right, Ireally dothink there isalottothispiece,\nonce I’vegotten everything down Ihave from thetapes andmy\nnotes.”\nIgetacallonSunday afternoon and Ipicked right up—I\nknew itwasJessica. Iwasrelieved; butatthesame time Iwas\nambivalent. Ididn’t know when totellherIstillrepresented\nHoward andIstillwasn’t sure about theethics ofrepresenting\nheroreven inreferring hertoanother agent. Nevertheless, I\nhadtofindoutmore about herproject. Weagreed tomeet for\ncoffee.\n“Ithink it’sworth looking around atother options ,totheex-\ntent there isany interest. I’ve killed myself over thepast\ncouple ofmonths, andpretty much ditched thewedding info-\ncusing onthis piece this past weekend. I’dreally like todo\nsomething with this.”\n“I’m happy tohear it–Ireally am.It’sagood choice looking\noutforyourself likethis. Look—I amnotpromising anything.\n115\nLetmehave alook atthedraft, thetapes, everything andI’ll\ngive an assessment of what we can do.”\nAllofasudden sheshut down. Iadmit, Iwastrying togeta\nglimpse attheproject andhadlessinterest inhelping herca-\nreer. But it was a compelling story. I had to ease up.\n“Here’s how itworks, standard procedure: Icansign anon-\ndisclosure agreement with youandyouretain allcopyright, of\ncourse. Youjusthave totrust me.Ifyoudon’t trust me,wejust\ncan’t dobusiness together. I’lllook atyour project andtellyou\nwhat Ithink wecando.I’lladvise you. It’sabout you. It’sall\nabout you and your work.”\nI thought that might go over a little better.\n“Iknow this isyour magnum opus, sofarinyour career.\nYou’re holding itclose, Icanseethat. Irespect that. Butifyou\nhold things too close, you may lose opportunities.”\nAnd that wasitformysales pitch. Iwouldn’t goanyfurther\nthan that.\n“Thanks, Alan, Iappreciate it.Ithink it’sworth atry,then.\nLet’s do it. What do you need from me?”\nWhen do Itell her about my relationship about\nHoward…dammit.\n“We canwalk uptomyoffice, around thecorner onWilshire,\nor you can come by tomorrow?”\n“I’m headed outtonight onthered-eye. Ihave themeeting\nwith Hello tomorrow morning. Idon’t intend oncancelling that\njust yet.”\n“Good—don’t cancel. Hello aregood people. Butdon’t sign\nanything that will bind you. Let’s take a walk.”\nThere’s someone attheagency seven days since deals get\ndone atevery hour. The moment weexited theelevator, she\nwas starstruck with thephotographs along thewalls. Igave a\nlittle tour and shewas impressed. She printed outthedraft\nand notes.\n“Do youhave aminute? Imean, canIgothrough some of\nthisright now? Why don’t Iputthenew Tom Hanks movie for\nyou? Itwon’t beintheaters until next March. Come, it’sgreat.\nPrivate theater over here.”\nHow could she say no to that?\nHalfway through thepiece—which blew meaway—I wanted\nthe tapes.\n116\nIwalked over toherbag. Should Ireach inand just take\nthem? Should I ask her?\n“Jessica, dear, letmehave aquick listen tothetapes—few\nminutes. Then we’ll talk.”\n117\nChapter 22\nInstead ofspending mygirls weekend together with friends\nandcelebrating myoldroommate’s wedding, Iwasholed upin\nthehotel room transcribing andwriting andtranscribing and\nwriting. Ijustcouldn’t hold outwriting thepiece until Iwas\ndone transcribing alltheinterviews. There wasstillsome miss-\ningpieces, butthere was enough here toseek thecontract I\nwas promised from Hello.\nWas this going tobemymagnum opus? Astory about my\ndad’s famous friend? Ihadtoadmit, itwas pretty compelling\nand nothing like I’dever come across before. Itwas alive\nstory—happening right now—so there was actually some\ngossip-news appeal toit.News that makes news isalways\ngood. After speaking with theman ontheplane Irealize Ijust\ndon’t have thegumption tobeaHollywood player. Idon’t\nknow ifastory like this could ever land inmylapagain,\nthough, so I should probably milk it for all I can.\nI’llworry about thiswhen Ifinish it.Ihave tohead back to\nNew York and get the contract first.\nMydadcalled meshortly after Ilanded; itwaslate. Iwassit-\nting onthebus intraffic staring attheorange substance\nsmeared onthewoman’s legnext tome.Icouldn’t tellwhat it\nwas. Then Ipeered intotheplastic bagbetween herfeetonthe\nfloor andthere wasagiant bagofCheeto’s, open andhalfway\nempty. Iwould give myleftarm forCheeto’s right now. All\nweekend Idrank smoothies from thehotel gym andatenothing\nelse—for noother reason than convenience and cost. Inthe\nbridal party, they didn’t letusoutofourcage inthesuite until\nafter cocktail hour was over and somehow thetray wewere\nsupposed togetnever quite made it.SoIwas starving, sleep\ndeprived, shaking from coffee, andanxious togettothemeet-\ning.Irealized thiswasnotagood time tobeheaded toamajor\n118\nmeeting; mymind was mush after thisweekend andthered-\neye flight.\nAsIstumbled into their gleaming offices, about 20minutes\nearly formymeeting, Irealized Ileftmylaptop onthebus. Or\ntheplane. Ortheluggage area. Ohmyfucking god. Holy moth-\nerofChrist, thisismylife,thepast twomonths ofwork, Iam\ngoing to die.\nWhere isit?Bus? Phone number? Bus number? Thieves?\nRussian mobster identity thieves? Diditfalldown theluggage\nchute? Ihaditontheplane, Iputitinthebag, Ican’t even\nfucking remember. Isitsitting onmyseat ontheplane—I\nreached upformycarry-on intheoverhead, didIstep outinto\ntheaisle andexitwithout mylaptop? Ican’t fucking remember,\nholy shit holy shit holy shit.\nAsI’mhaving atotal mental breakdown inthelobby ofthe\nbuilding, mycontact walks inthedoor with atallcoffee inher\nhand. Shegave meabigsmile, must have taken onelook atme\nandhanded mehercoffee. Weexchanged pleasantries andshe\nunderstood myclusterfuck state ofaffairs from thered-eye. I\nfailed to mention the missing laptop.\nIamshaking atthispoint. Sweating palms, feverish, nausea,\nIfeltlikeIhadasudden onset oftheflu.Sheasked mehow the\narticle was going and Isaid itwas amazing, over themoon\nabout it,yadda yadda yadda. Iwas totally unfocused onthe\nmeeting.\nAllIhadwas thefirst third ofthearticle that Ihademailed\ntoher. Herboss walked in,themanaging editor, andimmedi-\nately hugged me.\n“Ilove thispiece. Iabsolutely can’t wait forit.This isgoing\ntobebig. Imean, this is,this iswhat Icalljournalism. You\nreally did some work on this, Jessie.”\nNoonecalls meJessie. Why would hethink that Jessica is\nJessie? It’snotcommon. DidIlook likeaJessie? Ilooked likea\nfucking train-wreck, somaybe that’s what made him think of\nJessie.\n“And those interviews—I can’t wait toseetherest,” said my\ncontact, who hadheld back when wefirst met. Though Iwasn’t\nsure ofherthoughts since shecould have been kissing her\nboss’ ass.\n119\n“I’m—uh—thanks—you know, there’s stillalotofwork—it’s\num—“\n“She’s really tired, justflew back onthered-eye—“ mycon-\ntact gracefully excused me.She opened afolder and offered\nmethecontract tosign. Ididn’t even know ifIshould besign-\ningithere orhaving alawyer look atitfirst? Fuck it,it’sjust\nan article, which is lost somewhere.\nIsigned asignature thatlooked likethescrawls ofadrug ad-\ndict withdrawing with a pen on paper, but it was done.\nThefalse andtemporary sense ofrelief lasted until Igotto\ntheelevator when Irealized thatthelaptop case alsocontained\nthe interview tapes. And of course I didn’t make a backup.\nHoly motherfucking shit.\nTheelevator doors opened andIranoutandnearly through\ntherevolving door ofthebuilding outinto thecold morning\nand screamed “FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!”\nIsatinfront ofthefountain atanearby building forIdon’t\neven know how long before Igotmyshittogether enough to\nmake some calls andactually trytomake anattempt atfinding\nthelaptop. Ileftmessages with people atthebuscompany and\nwith Continental Airlines, aswell asNewark Airport. Thebest I\ncould do was wait.\nIbitoffallmynails asIthought about everything that was\nlost, andtheimplications oftheir loss. The worst part about\nthetapes isthat they arelabeled H.Kessler. Allthemore in-\ntriguing toanyone who comes across them. Worse than that is\nthecontents ofthetapes. There was somuch off-the-record\nbanter about Howie, theD.A., potential criminal stuff—admis-\nsions ofguilt. Raw memories, realizations. Nothing that was\nsupposed toberevealed, noless inanarticle—and certainly\nnotontape. Though Moeventually agreed tobetaped, Ireally\npushed him just for my own convenience.\nReally convenient when I fucking lose them.\nIwaited. Igotabag ofCheeto’s atanearby deli and\nchomped away hoping my phone would ring with some news.\nNothing. So far, nothing.\nFuck.\n120\nChapter 23Howard Is Writing\nThe recent turn ofevents was evidence enough forHoward\nthat heneeded tobealone and stop destroying shit around\nhim. When heemerged from hisdrunken stupor, alone and\nwallet intact, onthebed ofastrange hotel room and fully\nclothed, heknew something was wrong. Hespent thenext\ncouple ofdays inthehotel room trying tofigure outwhat he\nneeded todoinorder togethisscreenplay offtheground. He\nscribbled some notes here andthere andtried toplot anout-\nline. Buthecouldn’t getitoutofhishead that Alan justwasn’t\nonboard with theidea. Hecouldn’t shake thenotion that\nFrank, hisFrank, might have stopped looking uptohim. Here’s\naguyHowie hadn’t thought about inyears, yetoneevening in\naChinese restaurant andhe’s immediately attached tothedy-\nnamic that they shared when they were kids. Itwasn’t a\nhealthy dynamic. Howie was addicted to Frank’s adulation.\nHedecided tocallFrank andtrytowinhimback—though he\ndidn’t have anyrational reason fordoing sobecause pragmat-\nically heintended ondeveloping acaricature outofFrank for\nhisstory—so there was noreal need toingratiate himself to\nhim. Nevertheless, Howard needed aclear head before he\ncould step forward.\nMeanwhile hehadtofind aplace tocallhome forawhile.\nThis was adecision only hecould make andhehadtoface it\nthat hejustcouldn’t stay atPunch’s anylonger. Heregretted\nhaving stayed there forthepast several weeks because itrein-\nforced aconnection. Howard hadhiscareer tolook outfor,his\nname and reputation.\nI’m laying down here thinking about these guys—these\nlosers—and how pathetic they are. They wait 50years forme\ntocome back toBrooklyn. And forwhat? SoIcaninsult them\n121\nallover dinner. And Frank, likealittle puppy-dog, keeps fol-\nlowing me. This guy’s the biggest loser of them all.\nThat was it.That’s thebeginning ofthestory. Howard was\ngoing tonarrate theplay-by-play ofthedinner. Mo, Frankie,\nPunch and Artallshowed their colors and thestory would\nemerge from there.\nHereturned from avisit toFrank’s house inBrooklyn with a\ncaraccident andthemedia onitswaytotrail him, sohehadto\nmove fasttofind ahome base towork from inorder tofinish\nthescript. Butbythetime heparked hiscarinthehotel gar-\nagebelow, there wasapool ofphotographers stalking himout\nanditwasunavoidable ifhegotoutofhiscar—there wasonly\none elevator out of the garage.\nHoward backed thecarupandleftthehotel. Hedrove right\nback toBrooklyn. Barrelling down theBrooklyn-Queens Ex-\npressway, thestretch from Prospect Park down toBayRidge,\npast Sunset Park, theroad waspatched andifyoudrove onit\nataconstant rate ofspeed, itsounded likebudump-budump\nbudump-budump formiles. Helistened totherhythm asitcom-\nforted him. Visiting Frank inBay Ridge was one thing—it\nwasn’t even close towhere they grew upanditwasarelatively\nclose drive. South ontheBQE, roping around thesouthern-\nmost part ofBrooklyn wasoneofthemore beautiful views, un-\ndertheVerrazano Bridge. Heremembered thebuilding ofthe\nbridge intheearly 1960’s andwhat aphenomenon itwas to\nseesuch amassive structure jointwogeographies—Brooklyn\nandStaten Island. Like another world. Hepassed underneath\nitandcontinued ontheBeltway andexited atCropsey Avenue,\nConey Island. Hispalms were sweaty. Hefeltalump inhis\nthroat. Atfirst itlooked likealothadchanged—new projects,\nfewkids playing outonthestreets, different storefronts, the\nmovie theater’s gone. But atsecond glance nothing had\nchanged. Still poor, stilldisconnected. Hedrove upanddown\nthestreets, remarking oldlandmarks andletting theflood of\nmemories collide with hisfeelings ofresentment, sadness, and\nanger of his childhood.\nThearea was immigrant-populated asitwas when hewas a\nkid,though there appeared tobemarkedly more black famil-\nies.There were fewLatin American immigrants there when he\nwas growing up.Now itlooked like theneighborhood was\n122\nentirely Spanish. Into theBrighton Beach area Howard contin-\nuedandhenoted that thesigns abruptly turned from Spanish\ntoCyrillic letters and recognized itasRussian. He’d heard\nabout theinflux ofRussian immigrants, mainly Jewish, into a\nconcentrated section ofthearea. Businesses were thriving,\nmarkets were bustling, and therestaurants and clubs looked\nlively.\nHeparked hiscarclose totheboardwalk andhesitated be-\nfore hegotout.Hedidn’t want toruntheriskofbeing recog-\nnized again—he couldn’t have thepress after him: hedidn’t\nhave anyanswers, good orbad, tojustify why hewashere. He\njustdidn’t want toknow himself. Hewashere andthat wasit.\nHismission istowrite thescript andfindaquiet place tostay.\nItwasMonday lateafternoon andthere wasnoonearound ex-\ncept old,Russian ladies sitting onthebenches overlooking the\nbeach. They looked like they were sitting there since 1959,\nwith scarves wrapped over their heads andunder their chins,\nheavy coats, and ruddy cheeks.\nHestrolled theboardwalk andcaught aglimpse ofabanner\nhanging over alarge high-rise tower onthebeach advertising\nlong- and short-term leases forluxury condos. Hewalked in\nand asked to see what’s available.\n“Iwant thehigher floors, thehighest. Youhave something on\nthe top floor?” he asked the clerk in the leasing office.\n“You vant penthouse? Veheve oneavailable. Youmust take it\nnow, before ozer guycomes back vizmoney. Youvant it?You\nhave to take furniture though. Ve aren’t taking it out.”\n“Igotta seeitfirst. I’msure it’snice butIgotta seewhat I’m\nbuying first.”\nTheclerk took him uptheelevator tothetopfloor, walked\ndown along hallway and opened thedouble doors tothe\npenthouse.\nThough itwasn’t aSunset Strip penthouse, itwas ahuge,\nsunny 2-bedroom apartment with themost ridiculous furnish-\nings he’d ever seen. Over-the-top, rococo, flashy white leather\ncouches with mirrored coffee tables and statues inevery\ncorner. Itwaslaughable thatthiswasthemodel apartment. No\nwonder they were advertising ontheside ofthebuilding.\nNevertheless, Howard took itforthree months. This ishome,\nhe thought.\n123\nIdon’t believe I’minfucking Brighton Beach again. Idon’t\nfeellikeIhave anywhere else togo.I’mnotsaddened butI’m\nnothappy. Idon’t feel anything quite frankly. Istep outside\nonto theboardwalk andIhear theocean andthewind togeth-\ner—I don’t know what’s louder buttogether they block out\nevery other sound. It’slikestanding inavacuum. The airis\ncold anditmakes mewant totake giant breaths, orrun. What\nthe fuck am I doing here? What the fuck am I doing, period?\nAtleast Iknow thatifIhadanyquestions about loyalty toold\nfriends and those connections, well, that’s allforshit. They\nnever sought meout.Iwaseasy tofind, I’mfucking movie star.\nNever gotaletter. Never gotacall. Forget avisit. Ispend my\ngoddamned lifetrying togettheir attention and show them\nhow talented Iamand that I’mnotjustathug. I’vemade a\nwhole goddamned career around mytalent. Millions andmil-\nlions ofpeople paymoney toseemeinmovies. Iamafucking\nindustry. Myname isonrestaurants, cologne, andshoes. Ford\nmade aKessler edition truck. I’vebeen onSaturday Night Live\ncountless times andfortwoyears inthe1980s they hadasatir-\nicalcharacter modeled after me.I’veinspired dozens ofimitat-\nors,some having seen success themselves. Butitwasbecause\nofme.Imade thenew gangster movie—it’s mygenre. Noone\ncould have pulled offthose characters butme.Writers spend\ncareers making characters formetoplay. I’ve sustained the\nlivelihoods ofdozens ofagents, managers, businesspeople,\npublicists, stylists, drivers, assistants, hookers, bookies, and\nactors. Howard Motherfucking Kessler.\nAnd here Iamback inBrooklyn after making thetrek back\neast toshow myfour oldest andbest friends who Iamandwho\nIgrew tobe.And thenight turns outtobeafucking mess.\nWeeks atPunch’s house andtheguydoesn’t askmeoneques-\ntion about mylifeinHollywood. Iknow atleast they’ve seen\nmyfilms; butwho thehellhasn’t? Youhave toliveunder arock\nnot to see them. And they treat me like shit; the way they did in\nschool. I don’t have to put up with it anymore.\n“Why doyouthink they owe you, Howie?” Alan said. “Imean,\nthese aregrown men, everyone hastheir problems. Sothey\nweren’t there foryouduring your tough times inyour career.\nThey were there foryouasakidbecause they were literally\n124\nthere. Theworld doesn’t revolve around you, Howie, how many\ntimes have I told you?”\nNooneissupporting me.I’moutonmyown again. It’sbeen\na long time.\n125\nChapter 24Alan's Turning Point\nWhat Iheard shocked me.Atfirst Ithought that itwas just\nFrank’s small-mindedness andrelationship with Howie. Then I\nheard theothers speak about him. Ihadnoidea what abastard\nhewas toeveryone asyoung kids. Hestarted fights andran\naway. Hestole girlfriends justtogetthenegative attention of\nhisfriends. Hestole everything hegothishands on.Hehada\ndrinking problem even asfarback asjunior high school. He\njoined theNavy after high school toavoid going tojail.Henev-\neractually graduated from high school. Hemay begay. Hehad\nsex with his cousin. His name is Kesselbacher.\nHoly shit.\nSoofcourse Icouldn’t getheroutofmyhead. Ihope she\ncalls me,butIknow shewon’t. ShehastobePunch’s daugh-\nter;Isuppose Icould look him upandfind her, andtellher\nwho Iam.Thewhole thing issoawkward. IfeellikeI’mplay-\ningboth sides andbetraying Howie. It’sreally myjobtofind\nhimawaytomake hisscript work somewhere, somehow. Ijust\ndon’t believe in it, and I don’t believe in him.\nIsaid tomyself years agowhen Ifirst started outinthebusi-\nness thatIwould failifIstopped believing intheprojects Iwas\nselling tostudios. Ididn’t have tolikethem, Ijusthadtoknow\nthey would succeed. Otherwise, ifIbecome known asapeddler\nofshit, thegood stuff won’t getrecognized. SoIowe ittomy\nother clients to keep the shit out of my office.\nGranted, Idon’t know what kind ofshit Howie iswriting\nright now—if he’s even writing. Hementioned something about\nstaying inBrooklyn and leasing aplace bythewater. Ijust\ncan’t seethisthing happening andIcan’t envision looking him\nintheeyeafter hearing allthestories about him. These four\nguys, almost none ofwhom have been intouch over theyears,\n126\nhave theexact same recollections ofalltheawful attributes of\nHoward—so it’snotlikethey colluded topitch thesame story\nto this journalist.\nI can’t figure what her motive is. I have to speak to her.\n127\nChapter 25Jessica Finishes The Article\nIreturned tomyapartment inHoboken later that evening and\nthrew thekeys onthecounter andcollapsed onthecouch. I\nwalked around thecityalldayintotal disarray. Idragged my\nbagbehind mealltheway down toWashington Square Park,\nwhere Iwatched some terrible street artists hustle tourists for\nchange. Mycellphone batteries were totally dead. Contemplat-\ningthelossofmylaptop, Ihadhoped tofindsome lesson orre-\ndeeming blessing. Innine hours ofdeep thought, Ifound noth-\ning good could possibly come of it.\nHopeless, Iplugged inmyphone andwent tosleep. Ididn’t\nwake until thefollowing dayaround noon when thelady who\ncomes tofeed thecatopened thedoor andcalled forQueenie\ninherhigh-pitched voice. Ofallthethousands ofpeople I\ncalled yesterday togetmylaptop, Ididn’t callthecatlady to\ntellherIwashome. Ididn’t rouse, hoping shewouldn’t notice\nmysuitcase stillsitting inthehallway. Sure enough, shedidn’t\ncallforme.Iheard herplay with Queenie foralittle while, and\nthen some clanking inthekitchen asshefedher. Just when I\nthought shewas gone, shewas shuffling around inthecloset\nwhere thecat’s litter boxwas. Itseemed totake forever, and\nnow Ihad topee. She played with thecatsome more. How\nfucking long could shebehere? Didn’t shehave other animals\nto feed? My apartment isn’t that nice.\nFinally Iheard herbidQueenie goodbye. Ilayinbedlisten-\ningtothebanality around me:thesuper wassweeping (orrak-\ning?) thesidewalk outfront with heavy, violent brushes; the\nbeeping ofatruck backing up;andthefaint echo ofvoices and\nkeys inthehallway coming upthestairs. IfeltlikeIcouldn’t go\nback toanyofthiswithout successfully completing thisarticle.\nAnd now Ihad notools. Ihad committed totheguys—I\n128\ncouldn’t imagine having taken somuch oftheir time andnot\nwriting anarticle that isamazing andwell-received. Allofthe\nsoul-searching they had done about themselves, their child-\nhoods, their relationships with oneanother andwith Howie—I\nhadtoprovide some kind ofobjective, thearticle, sothey could\nunderstand their own thoughts andvalidate thetime andcon-\nsideration they put into the interviews.\nSome oftheinterviews were painful, Icould tell.Ringing out\ntheoldmemories andpushing them tothink about thememor-\niesthat weren’t sogleaming with joy,well, that’s myfault. I\nkept pushing. Ikept urging them tothink back about allthe\ntimes they had together, notjust thefunny and spectacular\ntimes. Notoneoftheguys could come upwith oneexample off\nthebat. They had tothink about it.Some even had tocome\nback tome days orweeks later with arecollection of\nsomething that really disturbed them about Howie.\nIthen realized how much ofajournalist Iwasn’t. Iwasusing\nareductive method togetthese guys toprovide answers to\nquestions that were leading toonly oneplace: Howard being a\nprick. There’s anangle, andthen there’s anagenda. Iwasus-\ningboth. Butwhy wasIsointerested innailing thisguy? What\ndidIhave against him? The whole thing started tomake me\nuncomfortable. I’m sitting atmykitchen table nursing a\nchocolate milk andstaring atthewall. What thehellwasIdo-\ning this whole thing for anyway?\nIthought back towhen itstruck methat doing anexpose on\nHoward Kessler would bemynext project—without anassign-\nment, without having worked onanycelebrity pieces before. I\nhadbeen sitting atmyfolks’ house when Howie was there. I\nremember seeing himskulk around thehouse andthen joltout-\nside when hereceived aphone callheappeared tobewaiting\nfor.Iwatched himpace theback yard absentmindedly kicking\nsome wetleaves while onhiscall. Hestarted tokick with a\nrhythm, butIdon’t think hereally even noticed itsince heap-\npeared tobevery engaged onthecall. This wasn’t a“Hey how\nareya”call. Itwas important. Icould seefrom thewindow in\nthedenwhen hewalked back uptotheporch, puthisphone\nback inhispocket, andstood attheback door forafewmo-\nments. Icouldn’t tellifhewas hesitating togoinside orifhe\nwas looking inside without engaging.\n129\nAtthat moment Iknew there was somuch more totheguy\nthan met theeye. Imean, there always is.ButIdidn’t trust\nhim. Ididn’t trust thewhole scenario with himstaying atthe\nhouse, charming mymother. Ididn’t trust hisfucking yoga and\nmorning jogs. Ididn’t trust hisfucking green smoothies he\nmade with mymother’s 30year oldblender. Iknow mybrother\nandIhave been very protective ofmydadever since helost\ntheleg. Really ever since this disease started ravaging him.\nButhe’s notsoftie, mydad. Hecould take ahitandgetback on\nhisfeet. Inever recalled himtalking about Howie much. Iknew\nthey were friends, butthere never seemed tobeanoccasion\nwhen Iremembered mydadseeking hisoldfriend out,despite\nhisfame. Idon’t know ifthat meant anything atall,andIsup-\npose I was trying to find out.\nI’vealways been driven. Nottoomuch andover thetop,but\ndriven toacute objectives. Zeroed inonthem likealaser and\npicked them apart toanalyze andexamine. Putting them back\ntogether, unfortunately, was never successful. Mycareer in\njournalism hasbeen interesting. Every story I’vecovered I’ve\nleftanindelible message. Atfirst itwasn’t deliberate; andmy\nmentor kept steering metobelessconspicuous. Having atten-\ndedColumbia Journalism School Ihave aprincipled approach\ntojournalism, butmyown imprint hasbeen more than justa\nsignature. Soinaway I’dliketobemore ofaTheroux than a\nCronkite.\nWhen itstruck methat thestory about Howie and theold\ngang reuniting was unfolding before myeyes, Icouldn’t pass\nuptheopportunity todocument it.Though Irealized—after\ngetting some unintended distance from theproject—that Iwas\ndoing more than documenting. Iwasinfluencing thecharacters\ninthis real-life story and how they thought about their own\nlives, and Howie’s. I was changing the story.\nNot sure how I feel about that.\n* * * * * *\n*\nIspent thenext couple ofdays making afewphone calls to\nlineupmynext assignment. Ipostponed acallwith aproducer\nforastory with nopressing timelines because Ijustdidn’t have\nitinme.Wednesday night myphone rang anditwasarepres-\nentative from Newark Airport. After Ihadlostnearly allhope\n130\nandcouldn’t even decide ifIcould even piece together astory\nwith what Ialready had written, plus myown recollection\nwithout it sounding totally fabricated, they found my laptop!\nApparently Ididn’t grab itwhen Ihung itontheback ofa\nbathroom door stall intheluggage pickup area. After theexhil-\naration andembarrassment wore off,Iasked why ittook three\ndays. She said that budget cuts hadledtotheelimination of\ndaily cleaning ofrestrooms incertain sections oftheairport. I\ncouldn’t believe apublic restroom atNewark Airport hadn’t\nbeen cleaned inthree days, butOK.And ofcourse now that it\nwas5:45pm, Icouldn’t justhopinacarandrunover there to\npick it up. I had to wait until office hours tomorrow.\nItwas thelongest night ofmylife. Isatatmydesk, sans\nlaptop, staring atwhere itshould be,eagerly awaiting 8am\nwhen I could reclaim it and get on with my work.\nItwillbethelastgoddamned time Iever save anything ona\nhard-drive without making daily backups totheweb. Never\nagain.\nIwalk intotheoffice beaming with glee. After Ipresent iden-\ntification and answered aseries ofreally dumb, irrelevant\nquestions, thewoman handed memylaptop case. Isatdown\nandopened ittoensure itwas indeed mine andthat nothing\nhad been erased.\nFine, looks good, still my baby.\nIgothome andwent togetright towork onthepiece again\nand reached in for the tapes.\nNo tapes.\nWhere arethetapes? Istillhadn’t even unpacked, soIran\nover tothesuitcase stillsitting inmyhallway andtore itopen,\nknowing about four seconds into ravaging thebag that the\ntapes weren’t inthere because Iwas listening tothem doing\nthe transcriptions on the plane.\nAfter countless calls andtwomore visits back toNewark, I\nhad to admit that my tapes were gone.\nI’m not sure there’s anything ok or good about that, either.\nFocusing onthearticle, Ithought Iwasactually inOKshape\nsince Ihad actually listened tomany oftheinterviews and\nlogged especially interesting quotes already. Sothecompre-\nhensive transcription was for context. But they were now gone.\n131\nIdidn’t even think about whether they would getinto the\nwrong hands. What did that even mean—the wrong hands?\nI spent the next few days in total seclusion and finished it.\nIhadtoputallthedistractions aside that were clouding the\nobjectives ofthis piece. Not myeveryday distractions like\nOprah, HuffingtonPost, orTwitter. Distractions like the\nthought ofwho hadthese tapes with myname, Howie’s name,\nandthesubjects’ name oneach tape. Therevealing details of\nthecontents ofthetapes. The sworn-to-secrecy oaths Itook\nwith Frank, Mo, Artand mydadthat only theontherecord\nstuff would appear inthearticle—which didn’t preclude me\nfrom stillrecording (with disclosure) theentirety oftheconver-\nsations. These were unedited, rawtapes tobeused ascontext\nformeasawriter. These were nottapes intended todisparage\nHowie—though they absolutely could, asanunintended cir-\ncumstance. Or maybe intended.\nThis isoneproject that hassucked thelifeoutofme.Ihave\nnever submerged myself insuch aproject that was simply an\narticle. Emotionally, though Ididn’t know these subjects, they\nwere allapart ofwho mydadis.Allthose years growing upwe\nwere close, butIfeltthere was ahuge part ofhislifethat he\ndidn’t reveal easily tomebecause, well, itwasugly. Heprotec-\ntedmefrom even knowing about thedetails that forhim, and\ntheothers, were soagonizing. Thepoverty, negligence, chaos,\nfrom which heranand aspired toescape. Ilearned that he\npushed mybrother andIhard toexcel andprovided anover-\nbearing hand ofguidance that henever had. Hedidn’t want us\ntostruggle through ouryouth andwander through ouradoles-\ncence without thetools tomake theright decisions. Mydad\nlearned thehard wayhow tomake theright decisions. Henev-\nerlearned totake care ofhimself, physically atleast, andhere\nhe is rolling around in a chair.\nIhave abeta-reader group Iusually useforwriting before I\ngetittoaneditor. This time Isent ittomydad, instead, toget\nhisapproval first. Idecided tobring itover inperson—since\nsending by email couldn’t assure he’d get it.\nIhanded himtheprint-out ofthearticle, double-spaced and\nstapled. Helooked atitforamoment asifhe’d never seen a\npiece ofpaper before. Heknew Iwas bringing itover, soI’m\nnot sure what his hesitation was.\n132\n“You sure youwant metoread this? Imean, isitdone—or, is\nit really for me?”\n“What doyoumean? Iwant youtoread it.You’re init.You\naretheeyes that Isawthiswhole thing from. Youhave toread\nit.”\n“Hm.”\nItwas themost loaded “Hm” I’dever heard. Hedoes that.\nHedoes itinorder tohave me—or whomever he’s question-\ning—ask allthequestions hewants toask, butwithout having\nhim have to ask them. Like a brilliant lawyer, except not one.\n“Do you not want to read it?”\nIknow hewanted metoaskthat, soIhesitated amoment,\nbutheheld thearticle andlooked atitasifhehadallthetime\nin the world to sit there holding it.\nHewavered hishead. “No, Idowant toread it.Ijustwant to\nmake sure that—“\n“Dad, enough, ok,Igetit,Iunderstand you. Ihear what\nyou’re saying. Just fucking read it, please.”\n“Ok, ok.” He paused for a long while. “Now?”\n“Oh jesus,” Iexclaimed asIstood upandwalked outofthe\nroom.\nIlooked around formymom who Ifound was cleaning the\nstove.\n“Hi,Ma.Ifinished thearticle, youknow, andDad’s reading it\nnow. Inside. I’m going to wait here.”\n“Ohthat’s fine. That’s justfine. Youwant something? Ihave\nsome chicken in the fridge.”\n“Really? Because Iamkind ofhungry. It’sbeen aweird few\ndays.”\n“You don’t look good. Imean, you’re thin, what happened to\nyour hair?”\n“Ihaven’t taken care ofmyself—been really trying toekeout\nthis article. It’s been a little rough.”\n“Well that’s just crazy, you know, crazy. You can’t travel\naround likethat andwork andnoteatortake care ofyourself,\nthis article isn’t worth that much to anyone.”\nYeah, itstarted outok,butinseconds theconversation went\nsouth, as usual.\n“Some chicken sounds great, Ma. Youhave some potatoes?\nOr noodles?”\n133\n“Of course. Which would you like? I’ll get both—“\nThere, that’s where the conversation should stay.\nAfter I ate I actually felt better. I hate when she’s right.\nIstarted tobecome anxious about mydad’s thoughts onthe\narticle. Itried nottofocus onit,butconversation with mymom\nwasn’t agood distraction. SoIwent upstairs towatch some TV\nand surfed around abit.Ifellasleep onmyparents’ bed—it\nwas thefirst time I’vetaken anapinabout 20years. Itwas\nperfect. I was starting to feel like a human being again.\nIgroggily came downstairs just asthesunwas leaving its\ncolorful mark ontheskytorival thefiery autumn leaves. My\nparents were both sitting atthedining room table. Mymother\nwasleaned across holding mydad’s hand. Hisother hand was\npropping up his head, it seemed.\n“Everything ok?”\nThe both looked startled.\n“Oh, honey, yes, fine—“ my mother said.\n“Jess,” he started, “This is one piece of work.”\nIwasn’t sure what hemeant. Ibecame terrified that he\nthought itwas shit. Orworse, exploitive oruntrue. Icouldn’t\nactually tellinmyyawning state ifhewas being sarcastic. I\nsatdown atthetable oneseat away andperched myelbows on\nitandleaned in,hoping hewould continue, which ofcourse he\ndidn’t.\n“Ican’t believe these guys said some ofthose things. They\ndid say them, right?”\n“Ofcourse, Ihave thetapes—“ Ialmost choked onthewords,\nbutdecided tokeep onrolling, “Nothing isfabricated.” Istill\ndidn’t know where hewas going. “Dad, didyoulikeit?Isit\npublishable? Are you angry?”\nHe didn’t reply.\n“Ok, now you’re hurting me—“\n“Jessica, no, please. It’s—this is very hard, you know.”\n“What? What ishard? Expressing feelings? Areyougoing to\nturn meinto Dr.Phil?” Iheard myown impatience andsoun-\ndedlikeanimpetuous teen waiting fortheanswer toherre-\nquest for the keys to the car for the night.\n“This ismyyouth youhave here. This isthepockmarked,\nugly, sad, lonely, abusive youth youhave inhere andit’sjust\nhard. It’s hard to read.”\n134\nHe didn’t look at me.\n“Ineed your approval tomove forward onthis. Ifit’snot\nright, ifyoudon’t feelright about this, please beexplicit with\nmeand help medecide what todonext,” Isaid inmymost\nwoken-up, together andwith-it tone. “This could bepivotal for\nme.”\nIhad noidea what Imeant bythelast statement. Ithen\nthought oftheguyontheplane, andtheoptioning andscripts\nanddevelopment andstudios. Iwasbecoming quite fullofmy-\nself. Ithink Ireally finally had theconfidence inmywork\nwithout needing myfather’s approval. Ijust needed him to\nthink I needed it before I moved forward.\n“It’s abeautiful article. It’sreally, really incredible. I’m\nstricken with overwhelming memories that Ithink youhelped\nmestirup.Some I’mnotsohappy about, sojustforgive meifI\ndon’t sound sopleased here. It’snotyour work, it’stheactual-\nitythat hurts. Ispent agood part ofmylifetime trying tofor-\nget,andhere itisallplain andinneatly typed words. It’shard\ntodigest, again. AsI’vetoldyouathousand times, youarean\nexcellent writer.”\nIstayed atmyparents’ house foracouple more days. Icalled\nthecatlady first, thistime. Igotmyenergy back, rested and\natewell, and gotthegumption tocallAlan Shiner, theguy\nfrom theplane, tosend himthearticle toseeifhewas inter-\nested inreading it.Icalled mycontacts atthemagazine and\ntold them I was delayed a bit and would be back in touch.\n135\nChapter 26Howard, The Screenplay\nHoward knew that writing wasn’t astrong point. Hehad a\nstory totell,butwith most start-up writers, couldn’t putpento\npaper. Hehaddozens ofsheets ofpaper piled uparound the\napartment, random thoughts, quotations, statements.\nHealso discovered theRussian nightclubs. There were few\npeople who recognized—or even cared—about him. Though he\ncontinued toevade theaggressive press, heknew that there\nwould beatime when hecame down tothelobby ofhisbuild-\ningthat there would beacache ofpaparazzi there. He’d\nalready gotten anew cellphone number inthehopes ofavoid-\ninghisown publicist. Hewas beginning tofeel independent\nandliberated forthefirst time inhislife.Hemade dinner for\nhimself. Hedrove himself around tothestore, thetrack, and\nthenightclubs. Hedidn’t have toanswer toanyone, aslong as\nhekept alowprofile anddidn’t cause anydrama. Itwasanew\nlife and he was sorting out how he felt.\nWithout apurpose, though—a reason forgetting outofbedin\nthemorning—he knew hedidn’t have long before he’d slipinto\nwhat heand hisshrink inL.A. called ‘recession.’ Hekept a\nroutine. Morning run, yoga, breakfast. News. Daily Racing\nForm. Coffee. Track. Lunch. Track. Nap. Dinner. Nightclub.\nHooker. Sleep.\nHeoccasionally found some time toscribble down some\nnotes about thescript, thecharacters, oraplotline. Heknew it\ncouldn’t continue. Though hehadmore than enough money to\ncontinue onalosing streak atthetrack andwith theroutine he\nhad, Howard’s egowouldn’t lethim fade away into theback-\nground like he was beginning to feel he was.\nHe was alone.\n136\nThough heconstructed awall around him foryears, hestill\nhadcompanions andasupport network inL.A. Henever felt\nanyone was honest with him, sohekept everyone atarm’s\nlength. Inthemonth orsohe’d been really onhisown and\nalone, hewasn’t sure it’swhat hereally cared for.Heliked ar-\nguments and debates. Heliked conversation. These days he\nspoke to hookers and waitresses more than anyone else.\nItwasn’t working. And hewasn’t finding adirection inthe\nscreenplay. He had to rescue himself from obsolescence.\n* * * *\nHehadn’t been over toSheepshead Baysince hewasinhigh\nschool. Hewas alittle surprised atsome ofthedevelopment.\nBefore heparked hiscar,hedrove back down Emmons Avenue\ntogointo Manhattan Beach toseethehouses. Asakid,this\nwas theritziest neighborhood anyone knew of,andthey were\ninproximity toit.While they used torunthrough Manhattan\nBeach togettotheoldCoast Guard base, Howard used tostop\ntolook atthehomes. Theyards, thetrees, thedifferent styles\noffacades. Thecars parked onthestreet andindriveways. It\nwasanother world. Henever even knew anyone from Manhat-\ntanBeach. Though Art’s cousins lived there andHowie hadal-\nways hoped tobeinvited toanextended family celebration of\nSukkot, he was never asked.\nHewassurprised toseetheoldGuard station wasnow Inter-\nboro College. Helamented theopen space anddunes andtrees\nthat used to be there behind the fences.\nInaflash, heturned around andhurried back toSheepshead\ntofind Mo, hisreason forcoming there. Hefound theboat,\nwalked right up the dock, and jumped on.\n“Mo, it’s Howie, lemme in.”\nHebanged onthewindow, andthen thedoor. There wasno\nanswer ormovement ontheboat. Howie stood there afew\nminutes, wondering what heshould do.Hewasn’t even sure\nwhy hewashere. Hedidn’t have much tosaytoMo,even be-\nfore the confrontation at the Duck House.\nHesatdown onthedock andgathered histhoughts. Itwas\nonimpulse that hedrove here. After awhile hecontemplated\nleaving; butheknew he’d never come back. Sohewent across\nthestreet tothedeliforacoffee andthePost. Hekept hishead\n137\ndown andhishatlow, sensing eyes onhim. He’d already made\nafew grand escapes from themedia inrecent weeks and\nwanted to keep it that way.\nHewalked back tohiscarandgotintowait forMo.About an\nhour later hesawsomeone walk ontothedock. ItwasMo,car-\nrying alarge bag. Heappeared tobelimping. Howard hesit-\nated forafewminutes togetacloser look; hewondered ifit\nwasn’t a good time to do this.\n“Mo! Hey!” Howard shouted ashegotoutofthecarand\nslammed the door shut.\n“What thefuck areyoudoing here?” Mosaid, notappearing\nto be joking.\n“Can I talk to you?”\n“Whaddya want? I—this isn’t thebest time. Ithought we\ncaught upacoupla weeks ago. What’s going on?” Mosaid, not\nso suspicious this time.\n“Can we go inside?”\nMo looked at him awkwardly.\n“Igotta getback—I wasn’t staying here long, justcome to\ndrop this off and pick up some papers—“ Mo said\nunapologetically.\n“It’ll be just a minute.”\n“Can’t we have a minute out here?”\n“You always didthat. Just when theconversation was about\ntogetnormal, Mo, youalways have away ofkeeping itona\nlevel of discomfort that makes everyone you talk to squirm.”\n“You come outhere toinsult me? Igotbusiness totake care\nofHowie, Idon’t have amovie waiting forme out in\nHollywood.”\n“Oh, is that it?”\n“Yeah, that’s it.”\n“Allthese years younever come seemebecause Iwork my\nass off and go and get famous?”\n“Who isthis guy. Areyou kidding? Come visit you? What\nplanet youbeen living onallthese years? Areyoueven Howie\nKessler underneath all that?”\n“Idon’t know what thefuck you’re talking about. But I\nwaited foryears tohear from one ofyou guys and you all\nfailed. We were buddies—we were friends—“\n138\n“And youupandleftusall.Youleftustodiehere inBrook-\nlyn. Youjustleft!” Moshouted, atleast toputadamper onthe\ndirection of the argument.\nHowie did take a minute; but not to cool off.\n“You and Frank just didn’t know how toend it,didyou? I\nmean, wewere having anice time together andyoucouldn’t\nleave it alone. It wasn’t his fault, you know.”\n“And where thefuck were youduring allofthis? Hanging out\nwith DeNiro orStallone? What thefuck doyouknow about\nFrank, thetestimony, orthe2fucking years Iwasted upin\nOssining?”\n“You know, Mo,youwere thesmartest oneofallofus.Itkills\nmethat you’re still hustling, and that you never didagod-\ndamned thing with your lifeexcept continue your games and\npetty crimes. You grew up to be a loser, Mo—“\n“Fuck you,” Mosaid ashestepped onto hisboat andclosed\nthedoor behind him, appearing unfazed byhisoldest friend in\nthe world.\nHoward was inastate ofconfusion and self-reflection that\ncould have sent himright toaheroin dealer; sohetook afew\nbreaths and stepped back offthedock and into hiscar. He\nturned ontheheat, puthishead inhishands, andtried tothink\nof what to do next.\n* * * * * * *\nHoward headed toNew Jersey where hethought hemight\nfind some empathy from Punch. Hewasn’t even sure that’s\nwhat hewas looking for,though. Hefeltcompelled totalk to\ntherest oftheguys andgetsome thoughts offhischest, now\nthat he realized what had been bothering him for so long.\nAllthose years seeing theshrinks, and noonewas able to\nput a finger on his discomfort with relationships.\nIntenminutes onthedock, Ifigured outthat Inever really\nshut thedoor after IleftBrooklyn. Thetemptation toreturn all\nthese years wasfought bytherational decision tostay andad-\nvance mycareer and seek happiness. But theunhappiness,\nstruggle, anddisappointment Ifeltasakidre-emerged now. If\nIcould just close thebook onthat part ofmylife, maybe I\ncould move on.Ijustneed totellPunch that heshould have\nstayed intouch. Heshould have reached outtome.What kind\n139\nofafriend just lets someone leave, and never even tries to\nwrite or call?\nHepulled intoPunch’s driveway andsatforamoment. How\nwashegoing toapproach him—the man who opened hishome\ntoHowie forover amonth andorchestrated thereunion? Who\ntracked him down after Howie couldn’t complete thecalls to\nhim? Who helped gethim outoftrouble countless times asa\nkid? Howie needed toend alltherelationships onhisown\nterms, and that was that.\nIwalked inthrough theback door after knocking alittle,\nhoping Adele would come over and letmein.The door was\nopen. Ihad alltheenergy Ineeded togetthis conversation\nover anddone with. Iwalked through thekitchen intothedin-\ningroom, thedreaded mausoleum oftacky china. Iheard the\nclocks ticking. Itletmeknow that theworld was stillmoving\nandIwasn’t stuck inbetween floors. Soothing anddisconcert-\ningatthesame time, thedifferent ticks. Nooneappeared tobe\nhome, which wasodd. Itwascoffee andstrudel time, 4pm. And\nafter that they would turn onthelocal news ontelevision. And\nthen dinner. And then reading.\nIsatatthedining room table forawhile listening tothetick-\ningclocks and staring atthephotos onthewall. Decades of\nmemories locked infaux-wood frames. Thephone rang 5times.\nIthought themessage machine might pick itup.Then the\nphone rang again, asmany times. Afew minutes later it\nhappened again. Ileftthehouse andsatinthecar. Iputmy\nhead back and waited, dozing off for a while.\nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\nKNOCK.\nJessica: Wake up. Wake up Howard!\nHowie: I’m up! I’m up. Yeah. Gimme a sec.\nJessica: What are you doing here?\nHowie: Is your father around?\nLong pause.\nJessica: He’s dead. We buried him yesterday. He’s gone.\nHowie: Jeeeezus—Jess, Honey, I’m sorry.\nJessica: What do you want from us? Why are you here?\nHowie: Listen don’t getupset—I mean, Iknow you’re upset.\nI’mnothere foranything. Ijust wanted tosayhello. I’llget\n140\ngoing. Anything Icando?You’re sitting shiva, right? Where is\nyour mother?\nJessica: I’mgoing inside. Ican’t have thisconversation with\nyou. You make me so angry; I want to blame this all on you.\nHoward drove away from thehouse intotal disarray. Hewas\nlost. Though hewent there toendtherelationship, hewanted\ntodoitonhisown terms. This wasnothisown terms. Helost\none ofhisoldest friends who knew him better than anyone;\neven though he didn’t know him at all.\nDays went byand hedidn’t speak toanyone. Ofallthe\nmemories flooding over thepast couple ofmonths, Howie\nreally concentrated and focused ontheones that were most\ncompelling with Punch. Hewasreally likeabrother, ascliché\nashethought itsounded. Though Howie had more brothers\nandcousins than hecared about, Punch was always there for\nhimasakid.When they gotolder andHowie started togetinto\nmore trouble, Punch wastheonetogive himtheguidance and\nself-conscious grounding thatheneeded. Punch wasthereason\nwhy Howie leftBrooklyn—to getoutanddosomething with his\nliferather than getsucked intothepattern offailure into\nwhich so many of their friends had fallen.\nHad henotreturned, henever would have known about\nPunch’s death, or his daughter, son, wheelchair, his life.\nHefound avoice andwrote hisstory. Over thecourse ofjust\nafewdays, Howard wrote ascript thathefeltencapsulated the\ngritty, sad, isolated world he grew up in. It was finished.\nHerewarded himself with atriptothetrack, hisonly true\njoy.Hesatquietly inhisspot atBelmont with hishatpulled\ndown lowand hisDRF inhishands. Heshuffled over tothe\nPaddock for a bite to eat.\nThis guywalks uptomeandholds aticket inhishand and\nsays Idropped it.Well ofcourse Idropped it,youfucking ass,\nit’salosing ticket. Oh,hesays. Irealized atthat point he’d\nnever been toatrack. Here inthedining room there’s notalot\noftickets onthefloor, Iguess they sweep them up.Butinthe\nGrandstand thefloor islittered with losing tickets. Iexplained\nthat tohimandhewas grateful andapologized forbothering\nme.Icould tellhefeltreally stupid. Iasked himwhat he’s do-\ninghere. Itwasatthat point herecognized me.Itried towalk\n141\naway buthewasabigfan.Wetalked forawhile andhejoined\nmeforlunch. He’s anoff-Broadway producer. Itoldhimabout\nmy script.\nTheproducer, Brad Siegel, hadbeen abigfanofHoward’s\nandwas interested inhisdisappearance. Henoted that there\nhad been several media reports of“sightings” ofHoward\nKessler throughout thetri-state area, and there was even a\nblog now devoted to marking the spot where he was seen.\nBrad asked toseeHowie’s script. Howie wasalittle hesitant\natfirst, knowing that thisguycould beastalker. Butthey got\nalong well and heseemed genuinely interested inthestory,\nandnotthestar appeal ofHowie himself. Howie excused him-\nselffrom theconversation, citing Punch’s recent death asa\nsource ofhisanxiety, butgave hisnumber toSiegel tocontact\nhim to discuss the script. He meant it.\nThey went back andforth over thecourse ofthenext week or\nsoonvariations oftheplotline, then Siegel called awriter he\nknew inBrooklyn togohelp Howie outinpolishing thescript\nandadapting astage version. Siegel andHowie went tooneof\ntheRussian nightclubs andbonded over vodka, dancing, anda\nNeil Diamond cover singer who sang only inUkrainian. They\nhadalotincommon, butnotreally. They didshare acommon\ninterest, in seeing success and exposure come from the script.\nSiegel sold Howard ontheidea ofrunning hisscript asaplay\nright after thenew year. Acontract hehadsigned months ago\nhadfallen through andhehadopen dates forthetheater that\nhewould love tofill.Hecould pulltogether thefinancing, find\nadirector, andgetacast together. Heowned hisown theater\nonGreene Street inSoho. Howard waselated that hecould do\nsomething without Alan, finally.\nHoward gotupthenext morning andbefore hewent onhis\njog,heleftavoicemail forAlan stating that he’d nolonger be\nneeding hisservices ashisagent. Hewould faxaletter later\nthat day to confirm the end of their engagement.\nHefeltenergized, independent, andconfident. This was his\nwork and he alone would see to its success.\n142\nChapter 27Jessica\nItwas awful. Itcouldn’t have been aworse, horrible, tragic\nway todie.Westilldon’t know what killed him, orifhekilled\nhimself. Mymother won’t hear mesaythat. ButIthink mydad\nmight have atleast contemplated it.Theofficial story isthathe\nfellintoacoma brought onbytheblood sugar thing andthen\nsuffered astroke. That’s allfine. Butwefound himface down\ninthetoilet bowl. Hehadtohave crawled from hischair, which\nwas noteven outside thedoor. I’msick tomystomach just\nthinking about it.\nThepast fewweeks mydadwas depressed. Ican’t saythat\nthewhole reunion wasatrigger, Ijustcan’t sayitforsure. But\nthe timing is awfully coincidental.\n“Idisagree. Itgave himsomething todo.Hewascalling res-\ntaurants, writing emails, keeping active, andreally looked for-\nward tostaying intouch with theothers,” mymother said as\nher voice still quivered when she talks about him.\n“Well, Ma,itdidbring back rough memories, right? Imean,\nhesaid some pretty provocative things that I’mnotsure he’s\nthought about in years.”\n“Provocative? What? Your father? Come on.”\n“No, Ma, really, you should hear the interviews.”\n“What, hear what interviews?”\n“The ones Ididforthearticle. Itaped many ofthem, soI\ncould go back and listen.”\n“You did what?”\n“Mom, forthe99th time, Irecorded theconversations I\nhad—with consent—to piece together Howard Kessler’s child-\nhood through hisfriends’ eyes. And that included Dad. He\ndidn’t justpoint meinthedirection, he’s apart ofthestory,\ntoo.”\n143\nShe looked atmefunny. Idon’t know ifshedidn’t under-\nstand orifshemisunderstood. Butshewasclearly notcomfort-\nable with this.\n“How much didyou and your father talk about this thing\nyou’re doing?”\n“Ok, Ma, first, it’sanarticle. It’sanessay about Howard\nKessler, Dad, Frank Russo, MoBuchwald, and ArtRaimi.\nWe’ve talked about this.”\n“Don’t yourealize what apainful childhood your father had?\nHow hehadtogetoutofthat place before itdestroyed him?\nWhy doyouthink allthese years we’ve—I’ve—kept himthehell\naway from those animals?”\nIwasalittle shocked. Iwasalotshocked. I’dnever heard my\nmother—the queen ofdeference—assert such astrong opinion\nabout something other than a handbag or kugel.\n“Ididn’t know you—I didn’t know. Youshould have toldme,\nMa, before I started—“\n“Sowhat, you’d stop? Oryou’d skip your father andwrite the\nstory without him?”\n“No, I don’t know—“\nIsshesaying it’smyfault he’s dead because Iasked too\nmany questions about his childhood?\n“Doyouwant metobedefensive? Because I’mkind ofspent\nright now, Ma,andIcan’t getmyhead around what Ithink you\nmight be inferring,” I said quietly.\n“I don’t know what you just said.”\n“Don’t play stupid with me. Don’t doitanymore. You got\naway with doing that with Dad, butIcan’t stand it.Just say\nwhat youmean, please, andhave some respect formyintelli-\ngence.” Ihadmyhead inmyhands, gripping myhair, feeling\ntheblood rush tomyface, and thetears streak down my\ncheeks.\n“Aren’t you feisty today. What gives you somuch\nconfidence?”\n“Where areyougoing with this? Why areyoufighting with\nme?”\nWeboth went silent andsatthere atthebreakfast table over\ntepid, over-sweetened Lipton teaandwhite toast, with theAM\nnews radio humming as our soundtrack.\n“I didn’t make Dad depressed,” I said and I got up to leave.\n144\nMy mother grabbed my hand to sit me down again.\n“I’m sure that after allthese years hetold you about his\nyouth. But maybe he left out some details.”\n“Iknow hewas poor, really poor. Iknew that before the\ninterviews—“\n“Honey, hewent hungry. And youknow why? Hisfather was\na dope addict.”\nIcouldn’t speak atthat moment. Ididn’t know whether to\nlaugh because theaccusation was soridiculous that aPolish\nimmigrant escaping thePogroms inthe1920s would dothat.\nJews aren’t heroin addicts.\nMymother continued, “His father took what little there was,\nand, well, hewas anaddict. That’s how hedied. Well, hegot\nhit by a trolley car, but really he wasn’t right at that time.”\nIstill couldn’t speak. Even ifIcould getwords outofmy\nthroat, Iwouldn’t even know where tobegin toasktheques-\ntions. So my mother continued.\n“Your grandmother was saddled with debt, andshewas os-\ntracized byherfamily andMordechai’s family. Mordechai was\nyour grandfather’s name. After hedied, your father wasabout\n7years oldthen, there was nocontact with family soyour\ngrandmother had nosupport. God only knows how shesur-\nvived. Allthose years youwondered why shewas sogrumpy?\nThat’s why. That’s thereason why. Because shehadaterrible\nlifewith aterrible man. And your father—your wonderful,\nsweet, father—“\nMom couldn’t go on after that. Neither could I.\nStill inshock, Ipieced together some fragmented stories\nmostly from mydad’s interviews andrealized there wasasub-\ntext tomuch ofwhat hewas saying. That sub-text—his aver-\nsion todrugs andalcohol, hisobsession with promises andre-\nsponsibility—underscored somuch ofwhy heworked tirelessly\ntoprovide stability tous,attheexpense ofhisown explora-\ntions inlife.Ire-read some ofthepassages inthearticle refer-\nencing mydad’s experience, and Iplugged inafew details\nlearned from mymom. Itgave himmore depth andadded even\nmore compelling angles tothestory—which started tolook\nmore andmore likeataleofdesperation forallinvolved, rather\nthan a pin-the-tail-on-Howie piece. That worked fine with me.\n145\nIfeltastrong desire tocallHowie, since thetwo ofthem\nwere closest friends and had known one another since they\nwere ingrade school. Iwanted totalkwith himabout mydad\nnow, though Irealize Iwasalittle gruff with himafewweeks\nago. He’s nodummy, Iknow Ididn’t likehim. ButIfeellike\nnow it’s different; Punch isn’t here anymore.\n“Hi, um, this is Jessica Plotkin—I just wanted—“\n“Oh, Jess, hiya, how are you doing? How’s your mother?”\nHe was surprisingly calm and solemn.\n“I’m, uh,we’re ok.It’shard. It’sjustreally hard now, formy\nmom. Forme.Everybody, myniece andnephew, mybrother,\nit’sjustbeen hard—“ Itrailed offandmumbled afewmore de-\ntails tofillinthespace ofthephone call. “Iwas hoping you\ncould fillinsome details about mydad, hislife,asakid,you\nknow, um, I just don’t know where to start, really—“\n“Oh, sure, wow, that’s along wayback. What doyouwant to\nknow?”\n“Idon’t know, that’s just it.Henever really talked much\nabout his upbringing. I know he was poor—“\n“Poor? Youdon’t know what poor is.Nooffense, honey, but\nyour father didn’t eatsometimes. Notthatwehadmuch, Ilived\ninatenement with 40relatives, butthere wasalways bread. I\nwould bring himbread. Wewere kids, 6years oldmaybe. Most\nofthegames weplayed was running around trying tosteal\nfood.”\nIstopped him right there, because Iwanted him toknow I\nlearned about mydad’s father. Atleast itwould help Howie\ntalk about what he really knew, rather than hold back.\n“I know about his father. I know about it—“\nIheard him sigh, and then take adeep breath. Ican’t get\nover how much iscommunicated non-verbally, and without\neven seeing someone. Hearing them breathe canexplain more\nthan words ever can.\n“When did you find out? Recently?”\n“Like an hour ago.”\n“You’re stillinshock, why don’t wetalk about thisanother\ntime? Nothing is going to make sense to you now.”\n“When thefuck isaheroin addict grandfather ever going to\nmake sense?”\n146\n“Well, hon, itiswhat itis.Listen, why don’t youandIgrab a\nbite to eat? You ever been to Brooklyn?”\nHave Iever, Iwanted tosay.ButIremembered atthat point\nnottoletontothefact that I’ve been digging around for\nmonths. Atthesame time Ididn’t want toplay stupid, because\nIreally wanted hishelp ispiecing together myfather’s life,and\ninunderstanding more about who Iamasaresult ofhow he\nlived as a child.\n“Acouple times—Williamsburg andPark Slope, mostly. Dad\ntook usouttoConey Island once when wewere young, andwe\nhaddinner atCarolina’s onMermaid Avenue. Isthat place still\nthere?”\n“Ah, Idon’t know—I’ve only been back here acouple of\nmonths, one ofwhich Ispent inWest Orange atyour folks’\nplace. I’mstillgetting afeelforitnow. I’mstaying inBrighton\nBeach. There’s anice Ukrainian café downstairs. Give meacall\nwhenever youwant tocome by.I’mhere forawhile andIdon’t\nreally go anywhere far.”\nHewas really decent. Icouldn’t getover it.Here’s thisbig\nHollywood star who conveyed hisheartfelt feelings tomeand\ngenuinely expressed a desire to help me.\nWhy the hell am I burying him with this article?\nIspent thenext couple ofdays wondering ifthearticle was\ntheright thing todo;knowing that itwas, butfeeling guilty.\nWhat ifHowie really wasn’t asbad aguyaseveryone made\nhim outtobe?And it’snotlikehe’s portrayed asabadguy,\njust insensitive and selfish. Who isn’t?\nIdecided justbefore finalizing thething andsending toHello\nthat Ishould give theagent guyacall, theonefrom theplane.\nI’m sure he’s forgotten about me already, but what the hell.\n“Alan Shiner, please, thisisJessica Plotkin,” Isaid toavery\nyoung sounding male secretary, orassistant, whatever they\ncall them.\n“And what isthisregarding?” heasked, playing therole of\ngatekeeper.\n“My article, heasked metocallhim. Met onaflight about a\nmonth or so ago.”\n“That’s it?”\nI couldn’t believe he asked that.\n147\n“Yes, that’s it—what thehellelse doyouwant from me? I’m\nholding theguy’s card. Ifyoudon’t want toputmethrough, I\ndon’t really give a shit either way.”\n“Just hold please andI’llseewhat Icando,” andnow allofa\nsudden because Iwas abitch this kidisacting likemybest\nfriend. Amazing how L.A. works.\n“Ms. Plotkin! I’msoglad youcalled! What anice surprise!”\nhejumped onthephone immediately. Ididn’t expect his\nwelcome.\n“Thanks, yeah, how are you?” I asked tepidly.\n“Great, thanks, it’salways beautiful inHollywood,” hesaid,\nlaughing.\n“Ihave afinal ofthearticle. Ihaven’t sent ittoHello yet,\nthough Ididsign acontract. Ifyou’re interested inseeing it,\nit’s about Howard Kessler, but as a kid in Brooklyn.”\n148\nChapter 28Alan\nIwasn’t sure when toexpect thephone call, ifever. Itwas\nsuch apowerful piece, with interviews thatcould bury Howard.\nIwondered ifJessica hadthegumption tofinish itandputit\nthrough the real test.\n“It’s done,” she said. No good morning, just “Done.”\n“Great, that sounds good. Letmehave it.Email ok?Youcan\nsend a PDF? You in a hurry?”\n“Ikind ofam.Imean, Ijustwant togetthisthing outthere\nand it’salready aweek later than when Itold I’dgetitto\nHello. I mean, with my dad and all—“\n“Ofcourse, sure, no,Iunderstand. Listen, getitover tome\nandI’llseewhat’s what. I’llcallyouback with some definitive\nnews. Keep your phone close.”\nInminutes, theemail came andmyassistant printed outthe\narticle. Iclosed mydoor andsatdown toread what shehad\nwritten about oneofmyold,dear friends andclients. Though\nherreporting issharp, Iwas floored bythecomments ofthe\nguys—all ofwhom Imet attheDuck House that night. IfI\ndidn’t hear thelast15minutes oftheconfrontations, Iwouldn’t\nhave believed thiswasthesame gang ofguys from therestaur-\nant. Butthesense ofparanoia, distrust, andopacity that was\nevidenced inthat lastfewminutes was pervasive through the\npiece I was reading.\nItalso reinforced allofthenegative feelings Ihad about\nHowie notjustinrecent months, butover theyears aswell.\nHowie’s charms often outweigh hisselfishness, hisdistanced\nandunsympathetic sense offriendship, andanugly aspect of\nhiscompetitive nature. Jessica Plotkin was anexpert manipu-\nlator ofwords, reporting, andinterviews, because shepieced\ntogether this disparate group ofindividuals with little orno\n149\ncontact over thepast 50years andreplayed their high times\nandlowtimes throughout thepiece, with theundercurrent of\nHowie’s destructive characteristics flowing throughout.\nIt was brilliant. She is an ace.\nIcould getthisthing made intoamovie innotime. Iamab-\nsolutely confident. Iwould betmykids’ college careers onit;\nandIwillbetmyown career, orwhat’s leftofit.Without How-\nie on board, I don’t have much to lose.\n“Get heronthephone NOW!” Iyelled, hoping tocatch her\nbefore she sent it anywhere else.\nIwanted tomake thephone calls andtake themeetings as\nquickly aspossible. Ihadn’t been thisexcited about aproject\ninyears. Literally, inyears. Ijusthadtogethertoagree. I\nwasn’t 100% sure. IfIjust moved fast enough, shewouldn’t\nhave enough time to waver.\n“Ihave tosay, your piece isexcellent, Ithink wecanreally\ndobusiness together. Imean it.Icansend yououtacontract\nmomentarily andIcangetstarted selling thisthing. What do\nyou think?” I said, holding my breath.\n“I’m notsure what youmean. Imean, I’mglad youliked it.\nSo, should I send it to Hello? I don’t know what—“\nShe really had no idea.\nIdon’t take advantage ofpeople. Igenerally letthem think\nthey take advantage ofme.With myconnections and experi-\nence inthis town, Icould make this girlafortune inafew\nphone calls. She just hastotrust me. Ithink shedoes. But\nthere’s onething that could keep usfrom moving anyfurther,\nand that ismy relationship—or former relationship—with\nHowie.\n“Iknow youwere justouthere, butyoushould plan another\ntrip. Bythetime youcome outagain, I’llhave some meetings\nsetup,some deals ready and set. Otherwise you can just\ngreen-light anyoftheprojects Ipropose. Movie, TV,syndica-\ntion, series, you name it.”\n“Um, I’d like to start with getting the thing published?”\nI laughed, and after a moment she did, too.\n“Honey, Icanputthisthing anywhere youwant. Better yet,\nanywhere likeVanity Fair, asafront cover feature. This isgo-\ningtomake waves, Miss Jessica, you are going tomake\nwaves.”\n150\n“Is there anything else I need to know?” she asked.\nIs this when I should tell her about Howie?\n151\nChapter 29Frank\n“Igotgreat news, Da—that guy, Lou, Mike’s friend from the\ncityinthestage guy’s union, hecalled meback andI’mstart-\ning tomorrow,” Dario said to me.\n“You up for it? Those guys really work—“\n“No they don’t, Frank, they’re notorious forbeing overpaid\nand they never lift a finger. Dario, who is this guy?” Dee said.\n“He, uh,Mike, youknow, Mike from 65th Street with thebar,\nhe’s a friend of his I guess—“\n“You gotta getyour shitstraight, Dario, youcan’t gointhere\nmumbling likeanidiot. How areyoufeeling, alright? Areyou\nupforthis? Don’t listen toyour mother, they’re going tomake\nyou work. I know them guys. They work hard.”\nIwas really happy forhim andhoped tohigh hellhecould\npull itoff. I’dhonestly never seen him soexcited about\nsomething—maybe because hereally pulled hisown strings to\ngetthis. Itcould betheturnaround he—and allofusaround\nhere—needs. I sure as shit hope so.\n“Yeah, dad, Ithink I’mready. Ibeen talking totheguyand\nhesaid there aresome things Igotta learn, butIthink Icando\nit.”\n“First yougotta stop thinking that wrestling isreal, Dario,\nsince you’ll beworking onthestage andall!” Petey said ashe\nwalked by, slapping Dario in the back of the head.\n* * * * *\nAcouple ofdays later Ilearned that Dario hadactually been\nshowing uptothejoband working. Iwas alittle surprised,\nsince hedoesn’t usually goback toajobafter hestarts it.Isat\ndown andtook alittle time with him; thiscould beagood thing\nfor him.\n152\n“So what’s the job? What are you doing?”\n“Eh, right now I’mjust hauling alotofboxes, heavy shit,\nmoving shit around. It’satheater downtown and Iguess\nthey’re getting ready forrehearsals, sowe’re making room for\nthebackstage area, dressing rooms, andbuilding outtheback\npart of the theater. There’s so much to do; I’m learning a lot.”\n“I’m glad to hear that, Dario, really glad. I can’t tell you.”\n“You know Ithink it’saplay with Howie, butI’mnotsure\nyet. I heard one of the guys talking about it.”\n“Really? Youdon’t say? Well keep anearoutbutdon’t make\ntrouble. Youhear me? Don’t make trouble. Youdon’t need any\nmore shit, Idon’t need anymore shit, andneither does your\npoor mother.”\nAplay about Howie? Ihope it’snotanother goddamned\nmusical.\nIguess Icould callHowie. Ididn’t know ifhewas heading\nback toL.A. orstaying outhere. Wedidn’t really leave itany\nway after heleftthehouse acouple months back. Itwas so\nawkward with him here. We’re notkids anymore, that’s for\nsure.\nSoafewweeks later Igotoffajobearly andIthought I’d\ndrop byand see how Dario was doing. More truthfully, I\nwanted toseeifheactually showed up,andifnot,forhow long\nhe hadn’t been there.\nTomysurprise, there hewas, working histailoff,taking or-\nders andhumping boxes. Atthisrate he’ll beintheunion early\nnext year. Iwas praying forthat. This kidneeded somuch\nhelp. Getting inwith theStagehands union isthebest thing\nthat could ever happen to him.\nIhung around and caught Lou, myoldbuddy’s friend who\nwas theshop steward and who was connected quite well, to\nseehow things were working out.Hethought Dario hadagood\nshot ofbeing able tostick around ifhekept itup,which made\nme happy.\n“You know, this production isaplay that Howie Kessler\nwrote—it’s supposed tobeabout hislifeinBrooklyn. Ithought\nyouwere intouch with him? Iheard hewas atyour house a\ncouple months back?” Lousaid. “It’s gonna beinpremiers ina\ncouple weeks. You should come by, you come in the back.”\n153\n“He wrote it?Dario said itwas about him. What thefuck?\nHe’s still here? Ididn’t even know. Yeah hedropped by,I\nthought itwas asend-off, youknow, he,uh,wetalked alittle\nand said goodbye. Ithought hewas leaving back toHolly-\nwood.” Iwalked away from Loubecause Iwassuddenly angry,\nand I didn’t want it to show more than I could control\nWhat thefuck isthisguydoing? Ifhe’s stillinNew York why\nthefuck didwehave abig,goodbye likeonOprah? Ithought I\nhaddone enough thinking about thepast. Every weekend when\nwegettogether towatch hismovies Ithink about thepast. I\nthought about hislife—what hehasandwhat Idon’t. Why he\ngotwhat hegotandwhy Igotstuck with what Igot. Idon’t\nstop thinking about that. Wenever started outany differ-\nent—both poor, kids ofimmigrants, wehadnothing. Iworked\nmyassofflaying bricks. This guydoes asong anddance inthe\nNavy and some Hollywood fagthinks he’s thegreatest thing\nsince sliced bread and sothey give him roles until Scorcese\ndiscovers him. Next thing youknow he’s rich, famous, theface\nofBrooklyn butinHollywood. Andnever aword about us;nev-\nerdropped mealineorafucking post card. Wewere insepar-\nable since grammar school. Some ofthebest memories ofmy\nlife I spend with this guy.\nAnd now, Idon’t know what thefuck he’s doing—writing a\nplay in New York—about US?\nI drove home steaming about the whole thing.\n“You don’t know what itis,Frank, stop with theagita\nalready. Wait’ll youseeitandthen getmad,” Deesaid, calming\nmedown, usually justtogetmeagitated again over something\nelse. “I’dbemore worried about Dario keeping thisjobthan\nwhatever the fuck is in this play or whatever.”\nAnd there shewent, getting mecrazy about something else.\nIf anything, she’s predictable.\nWespent theevening atthat Chinese restaurant talking\nabout oursecrets and theshitty things we’ve experienced in\ntheyears past. Ihope tofucking godhedoesn’t useanyofthat.\nTheargument between meandMo—if that goes public, we’re\nboth dead.\n“Idon’t trust him,” Isaid, ormaybe Ididn’t sayit.Ithought\nit. It was a big thought.\n154\nChapter 30Howard\nBrad Siegel absolutely fellinlove with Howie’s script. Brad\nwas aventure capital investor and managed afund offunds\nduring thedot-com era. Hegotoutbefore thecrash andwas\nsitting onapileofmoney. After sailing around theworld inhis\n46’sailboat forafewyears, hedecided tobemore active in\nthrowing hismoney away. Hehad always liked thearts and\njustcouldn’t spend enough ontheater fundraisers, sohetook\nanactive roleinoff-Broadway productions heinvested in.He’d\nstarted aproduction company and was fielding hundreds of\nscripts to produce in his theater on East 15th Street.\nHoward’s acting career began onfilm, buthealways yearned\ntobeintheater. With theexception oftwomusicals whose pro-\nductions were limited butTony-award-winning, hehad never\ncreated theopportunity; mainly because hewasaverse tocom-\ningback toNew York foranyextended period. Brad’s writer\ntweaked Howard’s rough script and notes into aworkable\nenough piece togetaproduction together. Brad alsohustled to\nincorporate other investors, using Howie’s name and star\npower. It wasn’t difficult.\nHowie took afairly active role inshaping theproduction.\nBrad made thorough introductions totheother producers, dir-\nector, andcasting director. Hisbigpeeve was toensure that\ntheactors were actually from New York andhadorcould do\nBrooklyn accents effectively, without sounding likecaricatures.\nThere was nothing worse than seeing anepisode ofLaw &\nOrder, shot inNew York, when theactors can’t even pulloffa\nsimple New York accent.\nThewhole production came together inweeks, itwasmiracu-\nlous byoff-Broadway standards. Word spread quickly through\nthetheater community that amega-star was interested notin\n155\nacting intheplay, butinwriting andshaping it.People piled\non.\nNotsurprisingly, Hollywood was notlooped in.Howard was\nrelieved that hedidn’t have todeal with apublicist. Forthe\npast several months he’d bypassed calls bythePRmachine\nthat heemployed fordecades andfocused onhisown needs.\nBetween that andnomore Alan, itwas likelearning toride a\nbike without training wheels forHoward. Sowithin thecourse\nofabout amonth, Siegel puttogether previews dates, acast\nandaproduction. Hewanted toblast thisonthemedia when\nallthedetails were crystallized andhegotabetter impression\noftheproduction from hisdirector—a seasoned off-Broadway\nguy with plenty of ups and downs under his belt.\nHowie plugged along inhisroutine when hewasn’t called in\ntohelp with rewrites, perspectives, orthoughts oncast. He\nrealized that they were justbeing polite when they called him\nintosupervise theauditions orhelp with atiebreaker inthe\ncasting, buthewent anyway andlenthisopinion. Hehadbeen\npleased with the way it was all going.\nSiegel asked himtostep outforacoffee onedayduring re-\nhearsals. Itwasoneofthefinal rehearsals before thepreviews\nbegan thefollowing week. Hewas only afewyears younger\nthan Howie, butcouldn’t have hadamore different lifeexperi-\nence. Butthere wasareason why hehadsomuch money, and\nit wasn’t because he was dumb.\n“Howie, do you really want to do this?”\n“Whaddya mean? Dowhat?” Howie said innocently andde-\nfensively at the same time.\n“This production. Idon’t know youandI’mnotgoing topre-\ntend that because I’veseen your movies that Iknow what your\nmotives are. Butthisisatough play. It’sheavy. It’spersonal.\nI—it’s hard to put it out there, if you know what I mean.”\n“No, Idon’t know what thefuck youmean.” Howie knew ex-\nactly what thefuck Siegel meant. Hewasjustinterested insee-\ning how he was going to frame the discussion.\n“Come on,Howie. You haven’t given itathought, that the\nbiographical aspects ofthisthing don’t exactly shine themost\npositive light on your friends?”\n“First ofall,we’re notgoing tochange afucking thing—you\nhave money down onthisandpreviews begin next week with\n156\nreviewers already settoattend. Sofuck that. Andsecond, they\narenotmyfriends. Ihaven’t hadcontact with these guys in50\nyears. Weallhaddinner lastfall, andacouple conversations\nthereafter. I don’t need to defend a fucking thing.”\n“Ok, alright, fine. Don’t getsoupset. You’re sodefensive all\nthetime. I’monly asking because I’myour friend now, notjust\nyour business partner.”\n“You’re goddamned right I’mdefensive, because youques-\ntionmeevery time youhave theopportunity. It’sagood thing\nyou’re afagbecause your wife would never stick around for\nyour shit.”\nThey both laughed, though theweight oftheconversation\nstill hung unresolved.\nButhow could Siegel have anyquestions about itatthislate\ndate?\nLater intheevening, Howie couldn’t shake what Siegel said.\nHewas angry, because after having finished thescript and\nseen theenthusiasm toproduce it,someone would question\nthestrongest points ofit—the characters. And that someone\nwas bankrolling theproduction anddoing allthelegwork for\nthepublicity blast. Butheused theanger tomask hisown self-\ndoubt. After seeing the guys and getting toknow them\nagain—and now, with Punch’s death—was hebetraying them in\nthis play?\n“Fuck no,” Howie said outloud, ashestood ontheterrace of\nhiscondo overlooking thebeach. Itfeltlikethesame cold wind\nthat sucked outhisbreath onthefirst dayhestood outside the\nbuilding on the boardwalk on the beach.\nHeclosed thedoors, pulled thecurtains closed, andwent to\nbed.\n157\nChapter 31Alan\nReading Jessica’s essay onHowie islikereading election cover-\nageinthelocal paper. Youknow what thewriter’s true allegi-\nances are, butthey appear towork hard toappear unbiased.\nThat very actoftrying nottocome across onewayortheother\nintimates bias. Icould tellthat Jessica wrote thisthing before\nherfather died. She seemed soinvested initwhen wefirst\nmet, and herintensity struck me.Inthepast couple ofcalls\nwith herinworking outthecontract and plans forpublicity,\nsheseemed eager togetitoffherdesk andgetHowie outof\nherlife.Shehadalready talked about another NPR assignment\npending that she wanted to get working on.\n“Honey, youneed tomake yourself available forinterviews, if\nthisthing goes where Ithink itwill. Between thebidding war\nthatVanity Fair andEsquire arehaving, andtheHollywood Re-\nporter giving memidnight serenades foradvance excerpts,\nyou’re going to be a busy lady in the coming weeks.”\n“Oh—really? I’mnotsure that really suits me,Imean—do I\nhave totravel outtoL.A.? Iwashoping tostick around bymy\nmom for a bit—“\n“You gowherever youwant togo.When things heat upwe’ll\nseewhat’s what. That’s what I’mhere for,totellyouwhat you\nshould be doing. Let’s focus now on the option for the script—“\nSowebatted around some details, andshewasvery easy to\nwork with. Itstilldidn’t make itanyeasier formetohide my\nrelationship—or should Isay,former relationship—with Howie.\nIhadalunch negotiation with astudio exec interested inop-\ntioning the piece for a film, just as I hoped would happen.\n“Lemme getthisstraight—she doesn’t even know yourepres-\nent Howie?”\n158\n“RepresentED. ED. Inolonger represent Howard Kessler.\nThere’s nothing wrong with what I’mdoing—I have aclean\nhead about it. No one has expressed any problems with it.”\n“I’m notexpressing anything. I’mjustasking. You’re defens-\nive for someone with a clean head.”\n“She’s notaninsider. That’s all.Idon’t want toscare heroff.\nShe doesn’t know how things work.”\n“Is she going to be a problem?”\n“No, notatall.She’s anangel. She’s anexcellent journalist\nand plans on continuing doing that.”\nWeboth laughed atthat suggestion, knowing that thesuc-\ncess that would come outofthearticle would nodoubt propel\nJessica into another direction entirely.\nDidshehate Howard? Didsheblame him forherfather’s\ndeath? Ordidshefeelguilty forputting together apiece that\nshines an ugly light on Howard?\nIcouldn’t afford tolose herifshefound outIrepresented\nhimandinterpret metobeaJanus-faced prick. I’mgoing tore-\nlease thetapes andletthemedia eatHoward upjustasthe\narticle is published.\n* * * * *\n“Things arejust moving sofast, Ican’t believe it,”Jessica\nsaid, sounding wide-eyed attheproposition ofbeing paid ahalf\nmillion dollars for the option to make a film from her article.\n“Enjoy it.Good work isgood work, anditgoes places,” Isaid,\nananodyne. Ifshecould seemesweating now, shewould know\nsomething’s wrong, soallthebetter we’re onthephone. Iama\nnervous wreck about leaking thetapes. Ihave ashady publicist\nknown forhandling stuff likethis. Like it’samob hit:nocon-\nnection tome,nophone records, weused athird-party mes-\nsenger and code words toconduct the whole operation.\nThey’re instructed tobegin dissemination assoon asthere isa\npublish date inVanity Fair; and24hours before that article is\navailable, aninterview inHollywood Reporter with Jessica is\nsetupwith some excerpts tothearticle. Iwanted togetsweet\nJessica outthere before shefigures outitwas mewho leaked\nthe interview tapes with Howie.\nAndmeanwhile, notafucking word from Howie. There hasn’t\nbeen aword about theguy inweeks. Ihave myassistant\n159\nmonitoring Gawker.com and theWhereIsHowie.com sites to\nseewhere hepops up,andIcan’t make heads ortails ofthe\nsightings. Ijusthope forhisown sake he’s notback introuble\nagain with the drugs or horses.\nLook, I’mnottaking thislightly. This isn’t retribution, either.\nThis ismanaging myclients’ career andwork. Iwould leak the\ntapes ifIhad them foranyone, provided itwould serve asa\nboost tothePRbehind their work. Sothisisn’t about Howie.\nDoes itlook badthat heused tobemyclient andwewere in-\nseparable atonepoint? Yes, absolutely. You just have tobe-\nlieve it’snotabout Howie. It’sabout mytwokids incollege and\nthe few years I have before I retire from this shit for good.\n“Mr. Shiner, it’sMs. Plotkin,” myassistant called. Iwas\ndreading the call. I knew it would come. I had to pick it up.\n“Hi Jess, what’s up?”\n“Don’t HiJess me, Alan, where thehell didyou getthe\ntapes? Doyouhave anyidea what ittook formetogetthese\nguys to talk at all, no less on tape?”\n“Wait a minute! Wait a minute—what are you talking about?”\nIhadnoidea theleaks were outyet—I figured Iwould bethe\nfirst onethey’d callonce thetapes surfaced. This PRguyis\ngreat. I guess he started in New York.\nOf course I made a copy of the tapes.\n“My friend atthePost justemailed methat they arelistening\ntoHowie tapes. Isn’t myarticle supposed tocome outtomor-\nrow? Fucking TOMORROW? You think this doesn’t look\nintentional?”\nI guess I underestimated how smart she really is.\n“Idon’t know what tosay. Icould keep denying this butI\nwon’t.”\n“OhChrist, Alan. Jesus, they aregoing tocome after me.Do\nyou realize they are going to come after me?”\nThere was true fear inhervoice. Itwasn’t justanger orre-\nsentment. I have made a grave mistake.\n“They are going to come after me,” and she hung up.\nI got on the first plane to New York.\n160\nChapter 32\n“Mr. Raimi, sir,uh,there’s someone here toseeyouwho is,\num, very insistent—he’s not a baseball person, sir, he’s uh—“\n“Well getridofhim, this isridiculous. We’re right inthe\nmiddle ofnegotiations, Sam, youknow thedrill,” Isaid asI\nwaved offmyassistant who slithered intotheconference room.\nAt least he had the sense to wait until we broke for coffee.\nTwo minutes later Ihear knocking onthewindow ofthecon-\nference room. Iknew this was forme. Ileaned back inmy\nchair and peered through the blinds and saw that it was Frank.\n“Atleast heblends inwell andisn’t conspicuous,” Isaid asI\ngotuptoexcuse myself from thenegotiations andstep outside\nwith Frank.\nFrank andIwere likepassing ships inthenight. Though we\nnever really hadanyproblems together, wewere never close\nfriends foranynumber ofreasons. Just different, Isuppose. I\nnever really hadanycuriosity orcompelling desire tofind out\nwhat hewasdoing after weallwent ourown ways. Yuri’s fam-\nilyowns some industrial properties inBayRidge andwewould\noccasionally seeFrank’s company trucks onasitethere, Russo\n&Sons Builders. Ihad assumed that hewas doing justfine,\nafter theindictments andwith hisface plastered allover the\nNew York tabloids back intheearly 1980s. Inever quite under-\nstood how he wasn’t knocked off.\n“Sir—I’m sorry, Ijustcouldn’t help it,hepushed me!” Sam\nsaid ashewas trying tomeekly defend himself against expec-\nted charges that I would hold him accountable.\n“Son, I’dbeworried ifyouwere able tostop Frank,” Isaid\nwhile Iheld myhand outtoFrank while Iputmyother onhis\nshoulder to guide him away from the conference room.\n“Art Iknow thisisn’t theright place foratalk, soletmejust\npreface this with my apology,” he said flatly.\nI guess I expected a more self-gratuitous statement.\n161\n“What’s up? Don’t tell me another death—“\n“No, notthat. Notatall,” hesaid, brushing through hisima-\nginary hair atop hisMr.Clean gleaming head, doubtless think-\ningofPunch’s recent passing. “Iknow you’re busy, and this\ndoesn’t look good, Iknow you’re inthemiddle ofthePlayers\nAssociation stuff andwith everything going onthisisthelast\nthing I wanted to drop on you.”\n“What? Wait aminute, let’s goinhere,” Iledhimaround the\ncorner and down thehall tomyoffice. Westepped inand I\nclosed thedoor. Ibuzzed Sam togetlunch orders inthecon-\nference room to stall the meeting.\n“How doIsaythis—uh, Howie isputting onaplay, aplay\nabout all of us, and him, and it’s—“\n“What’s the immediate concern? We can talk about\neverything later—is there something pressing Ineed toknow?”\nAt that moment I realized what Frank was going to say.\n“The guywho plays you, Imean, your character intheplay,\nhe’s uh—“\n“Oh fuck.”\n* * * * * * *\nIreturned tothenegotiations andfinished myvery long day,\nthough notwithout twoseparate comments inquiring about my\ndisposition andifIwasfeeling alright. No,thanks, I’mnotfeel-\ningalright. I’mabout toconfront aNew York sports media\nbulldozer whose intention itistocrush me.I’msounused to\ndiscussing thesubject ofmysexuality inpublic that I’mnot\nsure even how toapproach thiswith thepublicity division; orif\nIshould even employ myown agent forgood measure. Though\nitmay beunprecedented tohave agaycommissioner ofama-\njorsport andsomeone intheworld would welcome it,I’mnot\nsure I’dliketobethefirst onestepping intotherole. I’vespent\nmyentire lifeworking toward thisjob.Every ounce ofmyeffort\nasakidinschool, playing sports, andside-jobs wasdevoted to\nachieving thegoal that Iamabout toreach when thean-\nnouncement is planned in two weeks.\n“Deny it. Just deny it,” Yuri said, trying to be supportive.\n“You know it’s not that easy.”\n“How arethey going toknow? Wejustwon’t goouttogether\nin the city as much. It’s not like we do anything now.”\n162\n“How canInotdeny it?What ifthey gettoMarion andthe\nkids? And they will. Fucking press. These guys have nothing\nbetter to do.”\n“Ihave anidea—though youwon’t likeit.Why notgetoneof\nthegaygroups tosupport youanddoamedia barrage? It’sa\nlittle fluffy, butIthink GLAAD haspeople inhigh places inHol-\nlywood andNew York advertising people involved. Now they’ll\nhave a commissioner of a major sport.”\n“Ican’t stand those people. Ican’t stand theidea ofmaking\nyour lifesogoddmaned public. Who thefuck cares? Why\nshould anyone care? I just can’t stand them.”\n“Art, they could save your job, and maybe your life. Think\nabout it.Ifyou’re notgoing todeny it—and listen, wedon’t\nknow anything about thisplay, right—just beprepared tohave\na couple of weapons of your own.”\nThis isjustdevastating. Icalled Frank early thenext morning\ntofindoutifhehadthescript, orthepreviews schedule. Itried\nthecellnumber IhadforHowie butitdidn’t work. Ihadhis\nagent’s card buried somewhere inmywallet, Ithink, sothat’ll\nbe my next call.\n“This isArtRaimi, afriend ofHoward Kessler’s, wemet a\nfewmonths agoinNew York,” Ireplied totheassistant’s inter-\nrogatory. I waited a minute on hold.\n“Mr. Raimi, please continue tohold, Mr.Shiner willberight\nwith you. I’mconnecting youtohismobile phone—he’s gota\nfewminutes before hegets onhisflight.” Iwas shocked that\nhewas going totake mycall. Ididn’t even know what tosay\nonce he got on the call.\n“Art—I don’t represent Howie anymore, ifyou’re asking how\ntogetintouch with him,” hesaid, preferring topreempt any\nline of questioning that may involve him.\n“Have youheard about hisplay? Areyouinvolved with that\natall?And yes, I’dliketogetintouch with him—“ mostly to\nwring his fucking neck, but I wasn’t going to jump the gun.\n“Play? He’s inaplay? NotonBroadway, Iwould know about\nthat—“\n“No heapparently wrote aplay. It’sdowntown, previews\nstart next week. I’m trying to get my hands on the script.”\n“How’d you hear about it?”\n163\n“It’s been under wraps for the past couple of months but they\npulled the production together fast. Frank’s son isa\nstagehand.”\n“Ohforthelove ofChrist—I have toassume from thetone of\nyour voice that there are some controversial—“\n“Controversial is not the word.”\n“Iunderstand. Listen, Ijustdon’t know what tosay. There’s\nnothing Icando.Howie severed ourrelationship acouple of\nmonths ago, before theholidays. Idon’t know what thefuck\nhe’s doing—“\n“Well now youdo.Ifyouhave anyway ofgetting intouch\nwith him—I don’t know why he’s doing this. Idon’t know why\nhe would try to destroy me like this—“\n“Art, listen, Ihear you. This shithappens every dayinHolly-\nwood, andIknow your lineofwork isequally cut-throat. Just\ndistance yourself from thisthing, andwait toseewhat happens\nwith it.You know, just because he’s Howie Kessler doesn’t\nmean this play isgoing togoanywhere. The past two years\nHowie hasn’t exactly hadtheMidas touch soIhonestly don’t\nexpect much of a splash. Did you say you had the script?”\n“Not yet,Frank’s kidistrying togethishands onit.Hiskid\nis a dipshit though so we’ll see what happens with that.”\n“Listen—I guess I’mglad Ihave youonthephone. I’mgoing\ntotellyousomething that, well, though it’snotgoing tomake\nHowie’s play goaway, may take away from theattention onthe\nplay and focus on Howie and some of his missteps.”\n“Missteps?”\n“The article that Jessica Plotkin did,allthose interviews with\nyou guys?”\n“Yes, shewasvery good. Poor Jessica, Ican’t getover Punch.\nIs that article going to be published do you know?”\n“Not only isitgoing tobepublished, Hollywood istripping\nover itsyoung togettherights tomake thefilmandJessica is\ngoing toreap thebenefits beyond allexpectations. But the\ntapes, they’re out.”\n“What do you mean they’re out?”\n“Someone leaked them. Itwasn’t Jessica. Herbagwasstolen\natNewark Airport, Iunderstand shewasmugged anditwasa\nbit of a violent episode—“\n“She ok?”\n164\n“She’s fine, thearticle had remained under wraps onher\nlaptop, but the tapes were inanother bag and somehow\nwhatever thug gottheir hands onthem gave them tothe\ntabloids. I just got the call this morning.”\nIwas silent. Itried tothink what Ihadsaid onthose tapes.\nThere were things that could beused forthearticle—which I\nread aproof ofbefore shefinalized it—and there were things\nthat were ugly. Really ugly details about Howie, which were\nnotmeant forprint oranyother consumption. Iknew thetapes\nwere a bad idea.\n“Wow, that’s notgood. Ithink. Right? Imean, Idon’t know\nwhat anyone else said, butIforonedidn’t exactly paint the\nbest picture insome instances ofanyofus,especially Howie.\nSo Howie knew about the article all along?”\n“No, that’s just it.Hedidn’t know. This whole thing—both\ntheplay andthearticle andthetapes—is coincidental. Bizarre,\nhuh. Listen, myflight’s boarding soIhave tohang up.I’llbein\nNew York tomorrow so we should talk more.”\nAlan seemed decidedly unconcerned. Isuppose there’s noth-\ningforhimtobeconcerned with; he’s justanancillary charac-\nter in this whole thing.\n165\nChapter 33The Perfect Storm\nHoward wakes toaphone callfrom Brad Siegel. Heexpected\nBrad tobealittle frantic today since itwasthefirst preview of\nGetting the Old Gang Back Together.\n“Don’t open upthePost, whatever youdo.Infact, stay in\nyour apartment. Don’t even let the super see you.”\n“They found me? Big deal—“\n“No, Howie, there’s more toitthan that. Idon’t know what\nthe fuck we’re going to do—“\n“Whoa, whoa, what thefuck areyou allhysterical about?\nWhat’s inthat rag now?” hesaid, now actually slightly\nconcerned.\n“There aresome tapes, Iguess interviews with some ofyour\noldbuddies, recently? And some article isout—and that’s the\nother thing, there’s going tobeanarticle about youinoneof\nthe big magazines—“\n“What the fuck?”\n“Isayweputthisthing intohigh gear. Skip previews. I’llget\nthePRmachine toputsome serious asses inthose seats to-\nnight. Let’s make all the shit turn to roses. Ball’s in our court.”\n“Yeah, yeah—do whatever youthink isright, it’sallgood.\nJust lemme know what, uh—“ Howard trailed off and hung up.\nForthefirst time inyears, hewas flummoxed. Heresisted\ngoogling tofindoutwhat wasgoing onintheblogosphere and\nwent downstairs tothenewsstand, ashedoes each morning.\nToday was different.\n“Hey boss, somebody don’t like you!” thenewsstand guy,\nRajiv, yelled at Howard.\n“What’s thenew stuff yougotback there fortomorrow?” he\nasked.\n“I can’t show you that, boss.”\n166\n“Fuck you. What do you have back there?”\n“I got them all, boss, somebody else gossiping about you?”\n“Listen, lemme see what you got back there.”\nRajiv made asour face atHoward andledhimtotheback of\nthe store where the new issues were piled up.\n“Gimme aboxcutter,” hesaid toRajiv, toopen thebinding of\na stack of Esquires.\nHeproceeded tolook through GQ, Playboy, Variety, Rolling\nStone andafewothers before hecame across Vanity Fair.

I’m\nsorry for this,” Jessica said, peering out the window.\n“You know youlook paranoid. Ithought everything was ok\nwith your article. That man inCalifornia yousaid was taking\ncare of it all.”\n“Ma, youdon’t understand. There’s alotofmoving parts to\nthis whole thing.”\nItwastotally cliché that Ijumped 20feetintheairwhen my\ncellphone rang. Thankfully it was just Alan.\n“Ilanded, I’matthehotel, you should come into thecity\nwhere wecantalk. There areafewmore things youshould\nknow about,” hesaid, notsounding ascalm asIwould have\nliked.\n“Listen, I’mgetting outoftown, with mymother, because I\ndon’t feelsafe. Idon’t trust these guys—and they don’t trust\nme.”\n“Iunderstand—that’s probably notabadidea, butyoucan’t\nrunaway forever. And plus, there’s thething about theplay,\nit’ll be a diversion—“\n“Play?”\n“Yeah, that’s theother thing I’mtelling you. Howie wrote\nand is producing a play. It starts tonight—“\n“No previews? We didn’t know about this before?”\n“No, it’s apparently a rush-job.”\n“It looks like we planned this all together—“\n168\n“No it’sfine. Listen, what’s intheplay ismore disturbing to\nMo, Frank andArtthan what’s onthetapes. Iamconvinced\nyoudon’t need tobeworried about them, butIunderstand if\nyouwant togounder theradar forawhile. Butyouneed to\nkeep meintheloop where youaresoIcangetintouch—hold\non, there’s a call, don’t move—“\nIsatthere onmymother’s bedinutter disarray. Iliterally\ndidn’t know which waytogo.Andfucking Alan hasmeonhold.\nIt’snoteven lunchtime and Iwant tokillmyself. Ithought\nabout thisunbelievable turn ofevents: Had hebeen planning a\npublicity boost forHowie’s career? Was thisallapart ofhis\nplan?\n“Jess, youhave justsold therights toyour article foranew\nUniversal film. Thewhole deal looks tobeinthemillions, with\npoints. Myassistant isfaxing methepaperwork. Youcanput\nyour worries aside.”\n“I’m delighted, butI’dliketohave mykneecaps follow meto\nfame, soifyouwould please help mefocus onwhat thefuck to\ndosothese gorillas don’t come after mebecause ofthefucking\ntapes you stole and leaked, that’d be great, really.”\nIcould feelmyvoice quiver asmypitch increased, with that\ntone ofnear-hysteria that canonly come from sheer panic. My\nmother stopped fussing with herbag tocome sitonthebed\nandhold myhand. Shehadnoidea what was going on.She’s\nbeen inafogsince thenight shecame home andfound Dadup-\nstairs afewweeks ago. Icould feelmythroat tightening and\ntheairwasgetting harder tobreathe. Mymother picked upthe\nphone since Ihadn’t quite hung upand Icould hear Alan\nshouting into the other end.\n“Yes—this isAdele Plotkin—I don’t know what’s going on.\nButifyougotmyJessica intotrouble youneed togetherout,\nandthat’s allI’msaying about this, Shiner, youhear me? Are\nyou there?”\nGo Mom.\n“Fix it,justfixit.That’s allyouneed todo,justfixit.We’ll be\noutoftown, youhave hernumber, calluswhen everything’s\nsettled. Bye now.”\nAdele had such away about her, Ikeep forgetting how\nsmooth sheis.Allthese years, that’s how sheputupwith Dad\nandhiscompulsiveness, andJosh andI,andtheworld. Adele\n169\ncould make someone quake intheir shoes when she had\nto—but only when shehadto,when allother options ranout\nthe door, Adele hit in the clutch.\n“That man mentioned something about aplay inSoho—I\nthink it’sthesame name asyour article, title, dear. Maybe you\nshould think about going, orno.Think about what your father\nwould do.”\nWhat would myfather do?Hewould getonthephone and\ngeteveryone together and talk itout. I’mafraid things have\ngone toofardown theline. Sour. Butinlight ofthetapes being\nleaked, Ithought Ishould reach outtoFrank, MoandArt.By\nretreating they might think Ileaked them onpurpose and it\nwould give them all the more reason to come after me.\nIhad 28voicemail messages and needed tostart going\nthrough them soon. Things aremoving soquickly that I’mnot\nsure I have the confidence to make the right decisions.\nOne message was from Art:\n“Hi, ArtRaimi here, yeah, Iheard about thetapes. Ijust\nwant toletyouknow that Iknow youdidn’t leak them. Ihope\nyou’re ok.Whatever happens with everything going on,you’ll\nknow that Ithink youdidOK,kiddo, socongrats onthearticle.\nTheother thing isthisplay inSoho thatHowie’s producing. It’s\ntomorrow night, I’mgoing tobethere. Give meacallwhen you\ncan.”\nThemessage wasfrom yesterday—though Iwanted tobere-\nlieved, Iwasn’t, since hewasn’t really theoneIwassonervous\nabout with thecontents ofthetapes. Before Icalled himback,\ninthinking about whether Iwasgoing totellhimthat myown\nagent stole thetapes inanactofretribution that backfired, I\nlayback onmymother’s bedandwatched aladybug crawl up\nthecurtains. Itseemed togetlostinthefabric, butaminute or\ntwolater itre-emerged onthewall, walking casually between\nthe ceiling and the wall. Iblinked, and itdisappeared\naltogether.\n“Hello, thisisJessica Plotkin calling youback. I’msoglad to\nknow youknow Ididn’t release thetapes, thewhole thing has\nbeen awful. Iwilltrytogettotheplay tonight, Idon’t have a\nticket butIthink Icanfinagle oneasamember ofthepress. I\nhope toseeyouthere. Ihave aquestion though, that Ihope\nyou can help mewith, and it’sabout Frank and Mo, and\n170\nwhether Ishould beafraid of,um, concerned if—“ BEEEEP.\nOk, well said, then.\nTherest ofthemessages were unimportant right now. Ihad\nhoped Howie would have called, butIknew ofcourse he\nwouldn’t. I felt a little lost right now.\nWhat ifIshow uptonight andthey’re allthere? Fired upand\nangry—embarrassed, lives changed? Frank talks about hisaf-\nfairs andgirlfriends, how fucked uphiskids are, how fathis\nwife is,how hepaid bribes forno-bid contracts with thecity\nandhow hetook bribes from suppliers. Motalks about hisdrug\ndealing, hisenemies, hisex-wife who he’s stillfucking andher\nbillionaire husband, hisyears inprison. Artjust talks about\nhow messed upHowie isandalways was—what hedidtogirls,\nstuff hestole justtosteal it,allthedrugs hedid.Endless. And\nDad, well, dad really kept hiscool. It’slikeheknew tohold\nback—whether itwastoprotect meorjusttokeep composure.\nMaybe hejust didn’t feel strongly oneway ortheother and\ndidn’t care about Howie that much tospend toomuch time\nthinking about it.\n171\nChapter 35Getting the Old Gang Back Together\n“It’s exactly what happened—look, the restaurant, us,\neverything. Hedidn’t even bother changing ournames?” Frank\nbarked at Art.\n“SSSShhhhhh!” sh’d the lady behind him.\nHeturned and glared atherwith hissignature look that\nwould quiet anyone. Frank couldn’t sitstillintheseat. He’s too\nlarge and kept shifting his legs.\n“Idon’t believe this. Word forword, ourconversations. He’s\nmaking uslook likebuffoons, Frank, buffoons,” Artsaid, not\nbothering to whisper, in shock.\nNearly every lineintheplay evoked aresponse from either\nFrank or Art.\nAlan stood attheback ofthetheater with hand cupped onhis\nforehead, agape atthedialogue which waslifted right from the\nDuck House dinner they hadtogether; butwith added emphas-\nis making them all look like caricatures, except Howie.\n“Frank followed mearound likeapuppy-dog ever since we\nwere kids. Icouldn’t getridoftheguy. And now that we’re in\nour‘60s, you’d think hegothisown lifebynow? Apparently\nnot—he watches mymovies every weekend with hisfriends in\nhis basement. This puppy-dog never grew up…”\n“Ican’t sitthrough this—Art, this ishumiliating—it’s\nlies—how could hedothistous?“ Frank choked upandstood\nup to leave.\n“And theworst part washiswife—I couldn’t believe hemar-\nried thisgirl. Shelooked likeaMac truck andacted likeone,\ntoo.”\n“Are youfucking kidding me,youfuck!” Frank shouted from\ntheaisle, arms uplikehewasgoing tofight with theactors on\n172\nstage. “That’s me!That’s mylifeyou’re fucking with! Wewere\nfriends—don’t ever forget that, Howie, you fuck!”\nTheactors stopped foramoment. Theactor playing Howard\nwho was narrating theplay and was upstage and closest to\nFrank shaded hiseyes from thestage lights totrytosee, but\nhecouldn’t. Artstood uptotrytohold Frank back, orsomehow\ncontrol him when thetwo ushers came charging down the\naisle. Frank shook them alloffandwalked uptheaisle tothe\nexit. Artstood intheaisle foramoment, knowing alleyes in\nthetheater were onhim. Hereached down forhiscoat and\nwalked slowly uptheaisle. Helooked back once andthen con-\ntinued totheback ofthetheater. Theactors took aminute to\ncompose, and then continued with the scene.\nArtstood attheback holding hiscoat inhisarms, after peer-\ningoutthetheater doors tospot Frank, who hadalready left\nandwasoutofsight. Artnoticed someone else standing along\nthe back wall of the theater.\nAlan tried tostay outofsight, butnoticed justthen that Art\nhadspotted him. Helooked away quickly hoping toavoid Art’s\ngaze andthepotential ofaconfrontation. Alan wasalready so\nupset from thesituation that hecouldn’t possibly deal with\nmore complications. Jessica had already decided nottoshow\nup, still in fear.\nThe second acttackled exactly what Art was afraid it\nwould—his relationship with Howie asteens. There was more\nthan aheavy intimation that Artwas gayatthispoint, sohe\nknew what direction therest ofthescene would go.Hedidn’t\nwant tobethere toseeit.Ifheleftnow, there was achance\nthat nomedia would seehim leaving thetheater. Yuri was\nseated inthemezzanine—they planned tokeep separate in\npublic forawhile and Yuri knew someone attheNew York\nTimes who scored him a ticket.\nAsArtstepped outofthetheater hechecked hiscellphone\nandhadintended oncalling Mo, whose scene intheplay had\ncome first andshocked both ArtandFrank with thedetails of\nMo’s drug dealing, testimonies and indictment, connections\nwith themob, andcurrent relationships with younger women.\nItwas brutal. Before hehad achance tofind Mo’s number,\nsomeone grabbed himbytheelbow andrushed himacross the\nstreet dodging a speeding cab by inches.\n173\n“Iknow what’s going oninthere, sodon’t think youwere go-\ningtokeep this from me,” Mosaid intheshadows ofa\nshuttered marquee.\n“You think Ihave anything todowith this? Areyounuts?”\nArt replied as calmly as he could given the circumstances.\n“No, Ijustdon’t want anyone protecting that bastard fuck,\nHowie.”\n“Ihave nointention. Ifeelawful foryouandFrank, butwhat\nHowie’s done to me in this play is—“\n“He outed you?”\n“Yes—wait, how did you know?”\n“Art I’veknown youwere afagsince wewere kids. Idon’t\ngive ashit. I’mjustsorry youdidn’t realize itback then. You\nwould have been more fun.”\n“Or dead.”\n“Yeah, Isuppose that’s true too.What doyouplan ondoing\nabout this guy?”\n“Mo, thelastgoddamned thing I’mconcerned about now is\nwhat todoabout Howie. Ineed todosome damage control or\nfind abigrock tocrawl under. Ican’t letthisgetoutonhis\nterms. Ihave tomanage theinformation here andIdon’t even\nknow where to start,” Art said, beginning to come unhinged.\n“Take it easy, Art, take it easy. One thing at a time.”\n“And you, what hesaid about you—isn’t that stuff that\nshouldn’t be,uh,talked about? Like, settlements andnonpro-\nsecution agreements under seal or something?”\n“Right, none of it. I have my lawyer in there now.”\n“You’re not going to do anything—?” Art said.\n“Don’t worry about me.”\n174\nChapter 36The End\n“Get thefuck outofhere,” Dee shouted inbetween hertears\nandhair streaming across herreddened face, contorted inan-\nger, “Ihave toread about youinthepaper? Areyoukidding\nme? Ihave toREAD about you? Youcan’t come tomefirst and\nwarn methis storm iscoming? Forty-five years, Frank, 45\nyears—”\n“Idon’t know what tosay, Dee, itshouldn’t have happened\nlike this—“\n“Everyone weknow sawit.I’msohumiliated. And what you\nsaid about thekids! How could youtellother people? Thefour\nofthem—you were relentless—“ she broke down andpushed\nFrank out of the room. She pushed him out for the last time.\n* * * * * *\nArtjustassumed.the callwas going tocome, hejusthadto\nwait. There wasnothing hefelthecould doandresigned tothe\nfactthat MLB wouldn’t have agaycommissioner. Hewent into\nastatic mode forafewdays. While Yuri collected themedia re-\nports ofArt’s character intheplay, andinfollow-on interviews\nthat Howie did with the press. There were several.\nHetook onemeeting; theendofthePlayers Association ne-\ngotiations onnew contracts. There was adistinct sense inthe\nroom theentire afternoon ofHowie’s demise. Hedidn’t have\nthecommand heonce did—primarily because hedidn’t have\nconfidence inhimself. Here was asecret hehadguarded his\nwhole lifeandconstructed animmense false exterior. That ex-\nterior felltopieces inthewake ofthecoverage onHowie’s\nplay. Hedidn’t even follow Yuri’s advice todeny itbecause two\npublicists and disaster recovery specialists heconsulted with\nfelthecould getthrough thewhole episode byignoring it.He\n175\nlearned intheconference room that daythat ignoring itwas\nimpossible.\nArtsubmitted hisresignation. Yuri suggested hewrite a\nbook. Butuntil hecould manage thedepression that setin\nonce henolonger was involved inbaseball, hewas paralyzed\nwith indignation.\n* * * * * *\nModidn’t have anyproblem deciding what todoabout How-\nie.Theonly problem was indoing itfastenough: before they\ncame after him. There was nosense pretending that Howie’s\nplay was fictional—these guys knew better. And even ifitwas\nfiction, theimplication that acharacter resembling Mowasin-\nvolved inthekind ofinformation-trafficking that could bring\ndown anorganization wasenough evidence they needed tojus-\ntify taking him out.\nWithin aweek oftheplay debuting andthemedia circus that\nfollowed it,Moawoke toaseries ofsirens that jolted himfrom\nbed. Hiscuriosity gotthebest ofhim. Hethrew onhiscoat and\npeeked outofhisboat andsaw thetremendous blaze theen-\nlightened thenight sky. Hescrambled offtheboat andjolted\ndown thedock only toconfirm hisworst fear: thehealth club\nwasengulfed inflames. Theclub wasallhehad. Hisinsurance\npolicy was leveraged.

He’d begone\nsoon, too.\n* * * * * *\nTheVanity Fair article backfired—at least asaship-sinker for\nHowie. Therelease ofthetapes served asapublicity stunt for\ntheplay rather than support forthearticle. Though thearticle\nwas well-received, ittoowas justfodder forHowie’s publicity\nmachine togenerate attention around theplay, which wassoon\ntobecome adapted forthescreen. Brad Siegel represented\nHowie going forth and benefited tremendously from thelast-\nminute push hemade forattendance attheun-previewed play.\nThis demonstrated thepower ofword-of-mouth among the\nchattering class.\n176\nHoward returned toLosAngeles briefly tomeet with studio\nexecs andsign theplay away toHollywood.
