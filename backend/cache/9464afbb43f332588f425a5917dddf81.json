It dea ls with concepts: set mapping, fam-\nily, order, natural number, real number, ﬁnite and inﬁnite s ets, countability; with procedures:\nproof by induction, recursive deﬁnition, ﬁxed-point theor em, and with some immediate ap-\nplications. It concludes with a sketch of maximality axioms for inﬁnite sets, with the Axiom\nof Choice and other useful equivalents.\nThe resulting account was designed to support a component of a comprehensive three-\nsemester honors program, “Mathematical Studies”, conduct ed for years at Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity, by the author with the inspiring partnership of Walter Noll.\nThe author owes special thanks to Ms Nancy J. Watson for her su perb and tireless work\non the preparation of the manuscript.\nThe author also records his appreciation of Ms Kwong Lai Fun o f World Scientiﬁc for\nher unerring eye and tireless and insightful attention to ev ery detail that have given this\nwork its ﬁnal polish.\nv\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 6\nvi PREFACE\nSome Symbols\nThe symbols for logical connectives and quantiﬁers used in t his work are:\n⇒ read “only if” or “implies”\n⇔ read “if and only if” or “is equivalent to”\n∀ read “for all” or “for every”\n∃ read “for some” or “there exists such that”.\nThe following symbols denote certain sets of numbers, regar ded as endowed with the\nusual arithmetical operations and order relations:/C6the set of all natural numbers (including zero)/CIthe set of all (positive and negative) integers/C9the set of all rational numbers/CAthe set of all real numbers/C8the set of all positive real numbers (including zero).\nThese sets, with their structures, will be formally introdu ced in due course, but they are\nfamiliar enough to be used, before that introduction, in exa mples and remarks.\nFinally, some symbols are used to facilitate the reading:\nindicates the end of a proof or of some formally labelled exam ple, remark, etc. It\nis omitted after the statement of a proposition for which no p roof is provided.\n∗placed after the heading of an example or remark signals the u se of material not yet\nformally introduced or even lying outside the purview of thi s work. (For another\nuse of the asterisk see p. 6.)\n/triangledownsld\n/trianglesolidplaced in the margin encompass a paragraph, a passage, or eve n almost a whole\nchapter that the reader is encouraged to skip, at least initi ally, unless particularly\nmotivated.\n•records that the proposition or passage or phrase to which it is preﬁxed uses the\nAxiom of Choice in one of its variant forms. Little is lost, at least initially, if\nthe presence of this symbol is ignored.

Introduction\nIn this chapter we present the essential terminology, notation, a nd facts pertaining\ntosetsandmembers of sets, the most elementary ingredients of current mathematica l\ndiscourse. Successive chapters will introduce other fundamenta l ingredients, such as\nmappings, relations, numbers ...\nWe do not aim either at a philosophical elucidation of these concepts, or at a\nrigorous account of the foundations of mathematics as they are c urrently understood.\nThese are specialized subjects, attractive in their own right, but o f little immediate\nconcern to most practicing mathematicians or users of mathematic s; to engage seri-\nously in their study requires considerable mathematical experience and maturity. We\nmerely intend to clarify the usage of the fundamental concepts, d erive their simplest\nproperties and relationships, and make the language they constitu te available for use.\nUnderlying all mathematical discourse are concepts and rules of log ic. For an\nexposition of the relevant logical tools that is particularly well suited to our approach,\nwe refer to Chapter 2 of A. M. Gleason, Fundamentals of Abstract Analysis . The\nbook as a whole is recommended for its choice of contents and its pro fessional style.\nAlthough the usage adopted in it diﬀers in many particulars from ours , the book is\nan excellent aid to understanding. Chapter 1 and part of Chapter 3 of that book\nshould also be studied in conjunction with the present chapter.\nOur use of equality is exclusively as follows: the assertion a=bmeans that the\nobject (designated by the symbol) aand the object (designated by the symbol) bare\none and the same. In practice, what stands on either side of = may b e a complicated\narray of typographical symbols. The negation of the assertion a=bis denoted by\na/negationslash=b, and if it holds we say that aandbaredistinct objects, or that aisdistinct\nfromb.\nThe symbols := and =: are used in deﬁnitions: a:=bor, equivalently, b=:a\nmeans that aisdeﬁned to be (equal to) b. The colon stands on the side of the\ndeﬁniendum a, the term to be deﬁned, in order to contrast it with the deﬁniensb,\nthe deﬁning term. When the deﬁnition of an object is given in words, w e distinguish\n1\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 12\n2 CHAPTER 1. SETS\nthe words constituting the deﬁniendum by means of boldface type. For example, “A\nsquare is deﬁned to be a rectangle with equal sides,” or “A rectangle with equ al sides\nis called a square .”\nSimilar usages occur in the deﬁnition of a property of an object by me ans of an\nappropriate predicate. Thus, “A number nis said to be even if 2 divides n” (in\nthis style of deﬁnition it would be redundant to add “and only if”). In s lightly more\nsymbolic form we might write\nFor every number n,(niseven ) :⇔(2 dividesn);\nthe symbol : ⇔may be read “means by deﬁnition that” or “is equivalent by deﬁnition\nto”.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 13\n12. Sets and their members 3\n12. Sets and their members\nIn our presentation we give no formal deﬁnition of the concept of set. Speaking\nvaguely, whenever objects are thought of as collected into a deﬁn ite whole, a set\ndescribes this state of aﬀairs. A setis determined whenever there is an unambiguous\nanswer to the question whether any given object belongs to it, eve n if this answer\nmay be very diﬃcult to ascertain in practice, or is currently unknown .\nEach of the objects constituting a set Sis called a member of S; sometimes the\nterm element of S is encountered. The assertion that an object sis a member of the\nsetSis denoted by s∈S, and this assertion may be equivalently expressed by “ s\nis contained in S”, or “Scontainss”, or, more informally, by “ sis inS”, or “s\nbelongs toS”. Objects are often introduced as members of given sets: phras es such\nas “lets∈Sbe given”, “choose s∈Ssuch that”, “for all s∈S” are common; in\nthem, the symbol ∈has to be construed to give a grammatically correct reading, as,\ne.g., “choose a member sofSsuch that”. The negation of the assertion s∈Sis\ndenoted by s /∈S.\nWe regard it as an essential feature of the notion of setthat the identity of a set\nis determined by its membership: sets that have precisely the same m embers are one\nand the same. More formally, for given sets SandTwe have\n(12.1) S=T⇔ (∀x, x ∈S⇔x∈T).\nIt is useful to have a synonym for the term set. Thus a collection is a set, and this\nterm is used, in particular, when the members of the set in question a re themselves\nsets (or at least when it is material to state this fact): “collection o f sets” is more\nusual than “set of sets”. On occasion, the term class is also used as a synonym of\nthe term set. The term family , however, has acquired a quite diﬀerent meaning (see\nSection 41), and should never be used as a synonym for set.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 14\n4 CHAPTER 1. SETS\n13. Inclusion\nLet the sets AandBbe given. If every member of Ais also a member of B, we\nsay thatAis included in B, or thatBincludesA, or thatAis asubset of B,\nand we write A⊂BorB⊃A. In symbols,\nA⊂B:⇔B⊃A:⇔ (∀x∈A, x ∈B)⇔ (∀x, x ∈A⇒x∈B).\nWe note that A⊂Afor every set A. IfAis included in B, but is not equal to B, we\nsay thatAis properly included in Bor thatBproperly includes A, or thatA\nis aproper subset ofB, and we write A/subsetornotdbleqlBorB/supersetornotdbleqlA.\nMany mathematicians use a diﬀerent notation: they write ⊆,⊇,⊂,⊃where\nwe, with many other mathematicians, write ⊂,⊃,/subsetornotdbleql,/supersetornotdbleql, respectively. Unless the\ncontext is quite unambiguous, it is still advisable to declare one’s choic e between\nthese incompatible conventions in any piece of mathematical writing.\nWe note the careful distinction between the terms contain andinclude : “Scontains\ns” meanss∈S, i.e., “sis a member of S”; “SincludesT” meansT⊂S, i.e., “every\nmember of Tis a member of S”. (In very unusual circumstances, a set Smay\nboth contain another set T— as a member — and include T— as a subset —\nsimultaneously!) This useful distinction was recommended by Paul Ric hard Halmos.\nWe shall adhere to it strictly; most mathematical writing does not.\n13A. P ROPOSITION. Let the sets A, B, C be given. Then\n(13.1) ( A⊂BandB⊂A)⇔A=B\n(13.2) ( A⊂BandB⊂C)⇒A⊂C\n(13.3) ( A/subsetornotdbleqlBandB⊂C)⇒A/subsetornotdbleqlC\n(13.4) ( A⊂BandB/subsetornotdbleqlC)⇒A/subsetornotdbleqlC.\nProof . (13.1) is a restatement of (12.1) with S:=AandT:=B. (13.2) follows\ntrivially from the deﬁnition of inclusion. If A⊂BandB⊂CandA=C, then\nA⊂BandB⊂A; by (13.1) it follows that A=B=C; this observation, together\nwith (13.2), establishes (13.3) and (13.4).\nWe shall abbreviate “ A⊂BandB⊂C” to “A⊂B⊂C”, and similarly for\nmore sets, as well as for formulas such as “ A/subsetornotdbleqlB⊂C” and “A⊃B/supersetornotdbleqlC.”\nWe remark that (13.1) describes the most frequently used strate gic scheme for\nproving equality of given sets.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 15\n14. Set formation 5\n14. Set formation\nMost sets are deﬁned by specifying the properties that their memb ers must have.\nSuch properties are embodied in predicates , or sentence fragments: in “ nis even”, “2\ndividesn”, the sentence fragments “is even”, “2 divides ” are predicates, and they\nbecome complete assertions when “the blanks are ﬁlled in”. It is a mat ter for logical\nanalysis to determine whether a string of words, symbols, and blank s corresponds to\na well-formed predicate.\nIfP( ) is a predicate, the set consisting precisely of all objects xthat satisfy the\nassertionP(x) (i.e., allxfor whichP(x) holds, or is true) is denoted by\n(14.1) {x|P(x)}.\nThis is read “the set of all xsuch thatP(x) (holds).” This set is deﬁned more\nprecisely by requiring that\n(14.2) ∀y, y ∈ {x|P(x)} :⇔P(y).\nMost frequently, the members of the set to be deﬁned are assume da priori to\nbe members of a given set. If the set Sand the predicate P( ) are given, the set\nconsisting of all members xofSthat satisfy the assertion P(x) is denoted by\n(14.3) {x∈S|P(x)}.\nThis is read “the set of all x(contained) in Ssuch thatP(x) (holds).” This set\nis obviously included in S. The following assertion holds:\n(14.4) ∀y∈S, y ∈ {x∈S|P(x)} ⇔P(y).\nFor instance, the set consisting of all even natural numbers is {n∈N|2 dividesn},\nand a number n∈Nis a member of this set (i.e., is even) if and only if 2 divides n.\nIn the notations (14.1) and (14.3), the symbol xis a “dummy”, and may therefore\nbe replaced, without changing the set, by any single symbol that do es not appear in\nthe explicit formula for P( ) (or in that for S).\nLet the set Sand the predicates P( ) andQ( ) be given. Then the deﬁnitions and\n(14.4) yield\n(14.5) ( {x∈S|P(x)} ⊂ {x∈S|Q(x)})⇔(∀x∈S, P (x)⇒Q(x)).\nWe observe that, for every set Sand predicate P( ),\n(14.6) {x∈S|P(x)}∗={x|x∈SandP(x)},\nthus potentially reducing the notation (14.3) to an instance of (14.1 ). The notation\n(14.3) is not, however, merely a convenient abbreviation. The set- forming notation\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 16\n6 CHAPTER 1. SETS\n(14.1) relies on the premise that, for the given predicate P( ), there is a set consisting\nprecisely of all objects xthat satisfy P(x). Indiscriminate reliance on this premise for\nall conceivable predicates may unfortunately lead to complications, known as “para-\ndoxes”. We may regard it as a guideline of well-formulated mathematic al discourse\nthat the set-forming notation (14.3) is to be preferred whenever it is available. We\nshall therefore restrict our use of (14.1) to a few indispensable oc casions (and indi-\ncate its use by means of an asterisk, as in (14.6)); it is taken for gra nted that this\nexceptional use is permissible.\nApril 17, 2014 11:57 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 17\n15. Special sets 7\n15. Special sets\nThe set\nØ :∗={x|x/negationslash=x}\nhas no members: indeed, for every object y, the assertion y/negationslash=yis false, and (14.2)\ndisqualiﬁes yfor membership in Ø. By (12.1), Ø is the only set with no members; it\nis called the empty set . Ø is a subset of every set: for every given set Swe have\nØ ={x∈S|x/negationslash=x} ⊂S.\nA setSis said to be empty ifS= Ø and non-empty ifS/negationslash= Ø; the terms void\nandnon-void are sometimes encountered.\nAn essential peculiarity of the empty set must be noted. For every predicateP( ),\nthe assertion ( ∀x∈Ø, P(x)) is true and the assertion ( ∃x∈Ø, P(x)) is false.\nIndeed, this is the only case where a universally quantiﬁed assertion does not imply\nthe corresponding existentially quantiﬁed one: for every set Sand predicate P( ),\n(15.1)S/negationslash= Ø ⇔ ((∀x∈S, P (x))⇒ (∃x∈S, P (x))).\nAn assertion of the form ( ∀x∈S, P (x)) is said to hold vacuously ifS= Ø and it is\ndesired to stress that it holds for that reason. If a set Sis known to be non-empty,\nthe assertion ( ∃x∈S,) holds, and we may chooses∈S.\nFor every object swe deﬁne the set\n{s}:∗={x|x=s}\nwhose only member is s. This set must be carefully distinguished from the object\nsitself. For instance, Ø is empty, but the collection {Ø}is not. A set Sis called\nasingleton ifS={s}for some object s. The set {s}is sometimes called the\nsingleton of s. We note that (12.1) implies\n(15.2) ∀s,t, s =t⇔s∈ {t} ⇔ {s}={t},\nand, for every set S,\n(15.3) ∀s, s∈S⇔ {s} ⊂S.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 18\n8 CHAPTER 1. SETS\n15A. P ROPOSITION. Let the set S be given. Then S is empty or a singleton if\nand only if\n(15.4) ∀s,s/prime∈S, s =s/prime.\nProof . IfSis empty, (15.4) holds, since it is an abbreviation of\n∀s∈S,(∀s/prime∈S, s =s/prime),\nwhich holds vacuously. If Sis a singleton, we may choose tsuch thatS={t}. By\nthe deﬁnition of {t}and by (14.2), all s,s/prime∈S={t}satisfys=t=s/prime,and thus\n(15.4) holds.\nAssume now that Ssatisﬁes (15.4) and is not empty. We may then choose t∈S.\nBy (15.3), {t} ⊂S. On the other hand, let s∈Sbe given. By (15.4) with s/prime:=t\nwe haves=t, whences∈ {t}by (15.2); since s∈Swas arbitrary, we conclude that\nS⊂ {t}. By (13.1) it follows that S={t}, so thatSis a singleton.\nMany mathematical objects are deﬁned according to the following s cheme: “The\nonly such that is called ”; e.g., “For every positive real number s, the\nonly positive real number rsuch thatr2=sis called the (positive) square root\nofs.” To formulate such a deﬁnition, two steps are necessary. First, t o ascertain\nthat a given set Sis a singleton — usually by proving that it satisﬁes (15.4) and is\nnot empty. In the example, this set would be {r∈P|r2=s}. Second, to “extract”\nthe only, or unique , member from the singleton S. When the set Sis known to be a\nsingleton, we shall write\ns:∈S\nto mean that the object sisdeﬁned to be the only member of S. In the example we\nshould therefore write√\ns:∈ {r∈P|r2=s}.\nFor given objects s, t, we deﬁne the set\n{s,t}:∗={x|x=sorx=t}.\nWe note that\n(15.5) ∀s,t,{s,t}={t,s}.\n(15.6)∀s,{s,s}={s}.\nA setSis called a doubleton ifS={s,t}for some distinct objectss, t.\nWe observe that we could have used (15.6) to deﬁne {s}, thus avoiding one minor\ninstance of the undesirable use of the set-forming notation (14.1) .\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 19\n15. Special sets 9\nQuantiﬁcation over singletons and doubletons takes specially simple f orms. For\nevery predicate P( ) we have\n∀s,(∀x∈ {s},P(x))⇔P(s)⇔(∃x∈ {s},P(x))\n∀s,t,(∀x∈ {s,t},P(x))⇔(P(s) andP(t))\n∀s,t,(∃x∈ {s,t},P(x))⇔(P(s) orP(t)).\nFor every given set Swe consider the collection consisting precisely of all subsets\nofS. This collection is\nP(S) :∗={T|Tis a set,andT⊂S};\nit is called the power-set of S. By (14.2) we have\n(15.7) for all sets S,T, T ⊂S⇔T∈P(S).\nWe also deﬁne P×(S) :={T∈P(S)|T/negationslash= Ø}, the collection of all non-empty\nsubsets ofS.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 20\n10 CHAPTER 1. SETS\n16. Basic operations\nLet a collection of sets Cbe given. We consider the set whose members are\nprecisely the members of any set in C; more precisely, the set\n/uniondisplay\nC:∗={x|x∈Afor someA∈ C};\nthis set is called the union of the collection C. We should also like to consider\nthe set whose members are precisely those objects that are memb ers of all sets in C\nsimultaneously, i.e.,\n(16.1) {x|x∈Afor allA∈ C}.\nThis formula becomes questionable when Cis the empty collection: every conceivable\nobject would then qualify for membership, by (14.2), a situation to b e avoided for\nmany reasons. We shall therefore frame our deﬁnition so as to exc lude this eventuality.\nMoreover, if Cis not empty, then x∈AforallA∈ Cimplies that x∈Aforsome\nA∈ C(by (15.1)); thus every object qualifying for membership in the set proposed in\n(16.1) is already a member of/uniondisplay\nC. In accordance with our guidelines for set-forming\n(Section 14), we shall therefore deﬁne, for every non-empty co llection of sets C, the\nset/intersectiondisplay\nC:={x∈/uniondisplay\nC |x∈Afor allA∈ C}∗={x|x∈Afor allA∈ C};\nthis set is called the intersection of the collection C.\nWe observe that\n(16.2)/uniondisplay\nØ = Ø\n(16.3) for every set A,/uniondisplay\n{A}=/intersectiondisplay\n{A}=/uniondisplay\nP(A) =Aand/intersectiondisplay\nP(A) = Ø.\nFor given sets A,B, we introduce the notation\nA∪B:=/uniondisplay\n{A,B}∗={x|x∈Aorx∈B},\nA∩B:=/intersectiondisplay\n{A,B}={x∈A|x∈B}∗={x|x∈Aandx∈B};\nthese sets are called the union ofAandB, and the intersection of AandB,\nrespectively.

SETS\n17. Pairs; product sets\nFor given objects a, b, we often need a mathematical object that expresses the\nidea “a, and then b”, and thus depends on a, onb, and on the priority of awith\nrespect tob. We take it for granted that such an object is available; it is denoted\nby (a,b); and these objects, provided for all a, b, are called pairs . (We note that a\nmay well be equal to b.) The essential fact about pairs is that from the pair ( a,b)\nit is possible to retrieve aand thenb. (One should not be misled by the notation\n“(a,b)”, which incorporates the symbols “ a” and “b”; like any mathematical object,\n(a,b) may be denoted by some other symbol or name, e.g., π:= (a,b).) Speciﬁcally,\nwe take it for granted that\n(17.1) ∀a,b,c,d, (a,b) = (c,d)⇔(a=candb=d).\nThis property of pairs allows us to refer to aastheformer component of the pair\n(a,b), and tobasthelatter component of the pair (a,b).\nTo be a bit more formal: an object πis apair ifπ= (a,b) for somea, b. Ifπis /triangledownsld\na pair, (17.1) implies that the sets {x| ∃y,(x,y) =π}and{y| ∃x,(x,y) =π}are\nsingletons, and we may deﬁne\nformer component of π:∗/epsilon1{x| ∃y,(x,y) =π}\nlatter component of π:∗/epsilon1{y| ∃x,(x,y) =π}.\n/trianglesolid\nLet the sets A, B be given. It is necessary to consider the set consisting of those\npairs whose former components are members of Aand whose latter components are\nmembers of B. This set is\nA×B:∗={π| ∃a∈A,∃b∈B,(a,b) =π};\nit is called the product set of AandB.\nWhen deﬁning subsets of the product set A×B, it is customary to write\n{(x,y)∈A×B|P(x,y)}\nas an abbreviation of {π∈A×B| ∃x∈A,∃y∈B, π = (x,y) andP(x,y)}, where\nP(,) is a suitable two-place predicate. In particular, for every set Awe deﬁne the\nset\n∆A:={(x,y)∈A×A|x=y};\nthis set is called the diagonal of A×A. This terminology is unambiguous, as will\nfollow from Proposition 17B,(c).\n17A.

Sincex∈Awas arbitrary, we conclude\nthatA⊂C. Repeating this proof, with A, B, C, D, b replaced by C, D, A, B, d ,\nrespectively, we also conclude that C⊂A, and hence A=C.

Many mathematicians have been uneasy about the idea of intro- /triangledownsld\nducing the concept of pairas an undeﬁned notion, subject to (17.1), and have looked\nfor construction of setsthat would serve the required purpose; they aimed at reducing\nthe foundational complexity, at the cost of an artiﬁcial, counter- intuitive construc-\ntion, containing structure that is irrelevant for the purpose at ha nd.

The concept of a mapping\nThe idea of a mapping, along with that of a set, is one of the most basic of all\nmathematics. Any kind of unambiguous method by which one associat es with every\nobject in some set a member of another set (possibly the same set) determines a\nmapping . Thus, in order to specify a mapping f, one ﬁrst has to prescribe sets D\nandC, say, and then some kind of deﬁnite procedure by which one can ass ign to\nevery element x∈Dan element f(x)∈C. We callf(x) the value offatx. It is\nimportant to distinguish very carefully between the mapping fitself and its values\nf(x). Thusfis a mapping, while f(x) is a member of C. In older mathematics texts\nthe two are often not sharply distinguished, but such confusion is n ot permissible in\ncontemporary mathematics. When specifying a mapping, it is also ver y important\nto make sure that the procedure under consideration can in fact b e applied to every\nmember of D.\nThe setDof objects to which the procedure determining the mapping fcan be\napplied is called the domain of the mapping fand is denoted by Dom f:=D. The\nsetCto which the values of fmust belong is called the codomain of fand is\ndenoted by Cod f:=C. In order to put DandCinto full view, one often writes\nf:D→CorDf→C\nand says that fmapsDtoC, or thatfis amapping from DtoC. The phrase\n“fis deﬁned on D” expresses the assertion that Dis the domain of f.\nSuppose that sets DandCare given. Let two procedures be given such that each\nassigns to every member of Da value inC. We say that both procedures determine\nthe same mapping from DtoCif to each member of Dthey both assign the same\nvalue. Thus, if fandgare mappings, we have f=gif and only if\nD:= Domf= Domgand Codf= Codgandf(x) =g(x) for allx∈D.\n19\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 30\n20 CHAPTER 2. MAPPINGS\nTerms such as function, map, functional, transformation, andoperator are often\nused to mean the same thing as mapping . The term function is preferred when the\ncodomain is a subset of the set of real numbers or of the set of com plex numbers. A\nstill greater variety of names is used for mappings having special pr operties. Moreover,\nin some contexts, the value of fatxis not written f(x) but, among others, fx,xf,xf,\norfx. In particular, when the domain of fis a set of pairs, one pair of parentheses is\ncustomarily omitted, so that the value of fat the pair ( x,y) is then written f(x,y).\nIn order to specify a mapping fexplicitly without introducing unnecessary sym-\nbols, it is often useful to employ the notation x/mapsto→f(x) instead of just f. (Note\nthat we use /mapsto→instead of →for this purpose.) For example, the “squaring func-\ntion” sq : R→R, deﬁned by sq( x) :=x2for allx∈R, may be denoted by\n(x/mapsto→x2) :R→R, and one need not waste a symbol such as “sq” to give it a\nname. In most contexts it is very important to make a sharp distinct ion between the\nnumberx2and the squaring function x/mapsto→x2.\nMathematicians have the habit of considering, so soon as a certain k ind of object\nis deﬁned, the set of allobjects of that kind. Thus, given sets DandC, we can\nconsider the set of allmappings from DtoC. This set is denoted by Map( D,C ), so\nthat\nMap(D,C ) :∗={f,a mapping |Domf=D,Codf=C}.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 31\n22.

We can associate with fa subset Gr f, called the\ngraph off, of the product set D×Cas follows:\n(22.1) Gr f:={(x,y)∈D×C|y=f(x)} ⊂D×C.\nThus, Grfconsists of all pairs of the form ( z,f(z)),z∈D.\nNot every subset of D×Cis, in general, the graph of a mapping; those subsets\nthat are graphs can be characterized rather neatly. If DandCare intervals and if\nwe represent D×Cas a rectangle in a plane, this characterization will say that the\ngraphs of mappings from DtoCare precisely those subsets of D×Cthat are cut\nby every vertical in exactly one point.\n.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .f(x)\nxC\nDGrf\n. . . .. . . .. .. . .. ... ... .... ............................. ................................. ... .. .............. .. .. . . . . .. ........................................................................................................ ... .. .. . . . . . . . . .. .. .................................................................... ..... ... .. .. .. .. . .. . . .. . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .. . . .. .. ... .....................................................................\n.........................................................................................................................................................................\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n.........................................................................................................................................................................\n....................................................... ......................\n......................\n22A. P ROPOSITION .Let the sets D and C and the subset G of D×Cbe given.\nIf G is the graph of a mapping from D to C, then\n(22.2) {y∈C|(x,y)∈G}is a singleton forevery x ∈D.\nConversely, if Gsatisﬁes (22.2), then G is the graph of exactly one mapping from\nD to C, namely f:D→C deﬁned by\n(22.3) f(x) :∈ {y∈C|(x,y)∈G}forevery x ∈D.\nProof . Assume that G= Grffor some mapping f:D→C, and thatx∈Dis\ngiven. Ify∈Cis such that ( x,y)∈G= Grf, (22.1) implies that ( x,y) = (z,f(z))\nfor a suitable z∈D. Therefore z=xandy=f(z) =f(x). Thus {y∈C|(x,y)∈\nG}={f(x)}is a singleton. Since x∈Dwas arbitrary, Gsatisﬁes (22.2).\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 32\n22 CHAPTER 2. MAPPINGS\nAssume, conversely, that Gsatisﬁes (22.2); as we have just seen, if Gis to be the\ngraph off:D→Cwe must have f(x)∈ {y∈C|(x,y)∈G}; this shows that Gis\nthe graph of at most one f:D→C, namely the one deﬁned by (22.3). But with this\nchoice offwe ﬁnd that, for all ( x,y)∈D×C,\n(x,y)∈G⇔y∈ {z∈C|(x,z)∈G} ⇔y∈ {f(x)} ⇔y=f(x);\nand (22.1) then shows that indeed G= Grf.\nThere is thus a one-to-one correspondence between mappings fr omDtoCon the\none hand, and certain subsets of D×Con the other. One can use this correspondence\nto identify each mapping with its graph. Some mathematicians theref ore say that a\nmappingisa set of pairs of objects taken from speciﬁed sets, i.e., a subset of a\nspeciﬁed product set, and they do not distinguish between a mappin g and its graph.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 33\n23. Range and partition of a mapping; images and pre-images 23\n23. The range of a mapping; images and\npre-images; the partition of a mapping\nIt is important to realize that not all members of the codomain Cof a mapping\nf:D→Cneed be values of f. Those members of Cthatarevalues offform a\nsubset ofCcalled the range offand denoted by Rng f. More precisely,\nRngf:={y∈C|y=f(x) for somex∈D} ⊂C.\nIn order to test whether a given element yinCbelongs to the range of f, one has to\nsearch for a x∈Dsuch thaty=f(x).\nThe domain and the codomain are part of the speciﬁcation of a mappin g and must\ntherefore be given when a mapping is given. The range, however, is o ften unknown\nbeforehand, and it may be quite diﬃcult (and often uninteresting) t o determine it.\nConsider, for example, the function ( x/mapsto→x4+ 6x3−2x) :R→R. It is easily seen\nthat−1000000 is not a member of the range of this function, and that the refore the\nrange is not equal to the codomain R; it would, however, be a major undertaking to\nﬁnd out what the range of this function is exactly.\nMany problems in mathematics consist in asking whether a given equat ion has\nsolutions. Such problems are called existence problems . An equation can be written\nin the form\n(23.1) ? x∈D, f (x) =c\nwheref:D→Cis a suitably deﬁned mapping and ca suitably prescribed member of\nthe codomain C. We read (23.1) as “For which x∈D, if any, does f(x) =chold?”.\nAn element d∈Dsuch thatf(d) =cis called a solution of the equation (23.1).\nThe existence problem for (23.1) is then equivalent to the following qu estion: Isca\nmember of the range of f? If it is, then (23.1) has solutions; if it is not, then (23.1)\nhas no solutions at all. If the range of fis known, then the existence problem can be\nsolved for every choice of c∈C. Thus, to determine the range of fis equivalent to\nsolving the existence problems for the equation (23.1) for all choice s ofc∈C.\nA mapping is said to be surjective , and is called a surjection , if its range\nhappens to coincide with its codomain. If f:D→Cis a surjection, i.e., if Rng f=C,\nwe also say that fmapsDontoC(rather than merely to C). To say that fis\nsurjective is equivalent to saying that the equation (23.1) always ha s solutions, no\nmatter how c∈Cis chosen.\nWhether a mapping is surjective or not depends crucially on the spec iﬁcation of\nthe codomain. For example, the “squaring function” sq: R→Rdeﬁned in Section 21\nis not surjective, because −1 is not a member of the range of sq. However, if we let\nthe codomain be the set Pof positive numbers (i.e., numbers not less than 0), then\nsq :R→P, deﬁned by\n sq(x) :=x2for allx∈R, is surjective. The functions sq and\nsq diﬀer only in the speciﬁcation of the codomain; the domain and the r ule that is\nused to compute their values is the same. We shall discuss surjectiv e mappings and\ntheir properties in more detail in Section 32.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 34\n24 CHAPTER 2. MAPPINGS\nConsider again a given mapping f:D→C. IfUis any subset of D, i.e.,U∈P(D),\nwe deﬁne the image of Uunderfto be the set of all values of fat members of\nthe domain that belong to U. We denote this image by f>(U), so that\n(23.2) f>(U) :={y∈C|y=f(x) for somex∈U} ⊂C.\nIt is sometimes convenient to use the notation\n{f(x)|x∈U}:=f>(U),\nespecially when no explicit name for fis available; this avoids the cumbersome no-\ntation (x/mapsto→f(x))>(U). More generally, if P( ) is a given predicate, we use the\nnotation\n{f(x)|P(x)}:=f>({x∈Domf|P(x)}).\nObserve that this introduces usages of “set-forming braces” th at are diﬀerent from\nthe one introduced in Section 14, and used, e.g., in (23.2); there will b e no confusion,\nhowever, although the formula is read in a similar way: “The set of all ... such that\n...”.\nThe rule (23.2) deﬁnes a new mapping\nf>:P(D)→P(C),\nwhich is called the image mapping induced by the mapping f. The value of f>\natD∈P(D) is the range of f, i.e.,f>(D) = Rngf. Therefore fis surjective if and\nonly iff>(Domf) = Codf. Note that the image under fof the empty set is always\nthe empty set again, no matter what fis:f>(Ø) = Ø. The image of a singleton is a\nsingleton:f>({x}) ={f(x)}for allx∈D.\nIn most contexts, DandP(D) have nothing in common. When this is the case,\nno confusion can arise when one writes f(U) instead of f>(U) for eachU∈P(D),\nand many mathematicians do so. We usually do not.\nLetVbe any subset of the codomain Cof the given mapping f:D→C. The\npre-image of Vunderfis deﬁned to be the set of all members of Dat which the\nvalues offbelong toV. We denote this pre-image by f<(V), so that\n(23.3) f<(V) :={x∈D|f(x)∈V} ⊂D.\nThe rule (23.3) deﬁnes a new mapping,\nf<:P(C)→P(D),\nwhich is called the pre-image mapping induced by the mapping f. Note that the\npre-image under fof the empty set is always the empty set, while the domain of fis\nthe pre-image both of the codomain and of the range of f: thusf<(Ø) = Ø,f<(C) =\nf<(Rngf) =D.\nMany mathematicians use the symbol f−1instead off<for the induced pre-image\nmapping. We shall never do so, because of the danger of confusion with various other\nobjects.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 35\n23. Range and partition of a mapping; images and pre-images 25\nApplying the preceding deﬁnitions to the mappings f>andf<instead offitself,\nwe can construct the mappings ( f>)>and (f<)<fromP(P(D)) toP(P(C)) and the\nmappings ( f>)<and (f<)>fromP(P(C)) toP(P(D)). In the following proposition\nwe collect some elementary rules satisﬁed by the image and pre-image mappings\ninduced by a given mapping. The proofs are left to the reader.\n23A. P ROPOSITION.

We deﬁne the mapping 1 U⊂S:U→Sby the\nrule\n1U⊂S(x) :=xfor allx∈U;\nthis mapping is called the inclusion mapping of UintoS. It is obvious that\nRng1 U⊂S=U.

Indeed, 1 Ø⊂Sis theonly mapping from Ø to S(cf.\nSection 21 or Proposition 22A). On the other hand, there is obvious ly no mapping\nfrom a non-empty set to the empty set.\nFor each set Swe have the mapping 1 S:= 1 S⊂S; it is called the identity mapping\nofS.

We read g◦fas “fcomposed with g” (note the\nreversal of priority). Thus the values of g◦fare obtained by ﬁrst operating with f\nand then on the resulting values with g. The equality Cod f= Domgis essential to\nthe deﬁnition of g◦f; if this condition is satisﬁed, then Dom( g◦f) = Domfand\nCod(g◦f) = Codg.\nComposition of mappings obeys the associative law in the following sens e: If\nf, g, h are mappings with Dom g= Codfand Domh= Codg, then\n(h◦g)◦f=h◦(g◦f).\nThis rule is an almost immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of compo sition.

The sets in the places at th e head and\nthe tail of an arrow labelled fare the domain and the codomain of f, respectively.\nIn our ﬁrst example the mappings are f:A→B, g :B→C, h :A→C. Our\nsecond example illustrates the fact that the same set may appear in more than one\nplace, and the same mapping on more than one arrow. Mappings that are labels of\nconsecutive (i.e., head-to-tail) arrows can always be composed.\nIf, in our ﬁrst example, h=g◦f, this diagram is said to be commutative; the\nsecond diagram is said to be commutative if g◦f=h◦f; the third, if f=p◦hand\nk=g◦p(it then follows that g◦f=k◦h, etc.). More generally, a diagram is said\nto be commutative if, for any two chains of consecutive arrows that go from the same\ninitial place to the same ﬁnal place, the corresponding composites o f mappings are\nequal. Commutativity of a diagram is often indicated by the symbol × ×.\nLet the mapping fand the sets AandBbe given. If A⊂Domf, we deﬁne a\nnew mapping f|A:A→Codfbyf|A(x) :=f(x) for allx∈A. We callf|Athe\nrestriction of ftoA. More generally, if A⊂DomfandB⊃f>(A), we deﬁne\nf|B\nA:A→Bbyf|B\nA(x) :=f(x) for allx∈A. We say that f|B\nAis obtained from\nfbyadjustment ; and we say that finduces a given mapping gifgis obtained\nfromfby adjustment. Of course f|Codf\nA =fA. For arbitrary Bwe note that, by\n(23.8),f>(f<(B∩Codf)) =f>(f<(B∩Rngf)) =B∩Rngf⊃B, and we deﬁne\nf|B:=f|B\nf<(B∩Codf)=f|B\nf<(B∩Rngf).We have Dom( f|B) = Domfif and only if B⊃\nRngf. We say that f|Bis obtained from fbyadjusting the codomain to B.\nThesurjective reduction f|Rng: Domf→Rngfoffis deﬁned by adjusting the\ncodomain to the range, i.e., by f|Rng:=f|Rngf.

The mapping\n((f,g)/mapsto→g◦f) : Map(D,D )×Map(D,D )→Map(D,D ),\ncalled composition in D, of course satisﬁes the associative law\n(h◦g)◦f=h◦(g◦f) for all f,g,h ∈Map(D,D )\nas well as\nf◦1D=f= 1D◦ffor allf∈Map(D,D ),\nbut in general not the commutative law: g◦f/negationslash=f◦gfor somef,g∈Map(D,D ). (The\nonly exceptions occur when Dis empty or a singleton.) For given f,g∈Map(D,D ),\nwe say that fandgcommute , or thatfcommutes with g, ifg◦f=f◦g. A subset\nFof Map(D,D ) is said to be commutative iffandgcommute for all f,g∈F.\nA mapping f:D→Dis said to be idempotent iff◦f=f; it is said to be\ninvolutory , and is called an involution , iff◦f= 1D.\nMany questions in mathematics can be reduced to solving a problem of the form\n?x∈D, f (x) =x\nwheref:D→Dis a suitable mapping. A solution to this problem, i.e., a member\ndofDsuch thatf(d) =d, is called a ﬁxed point of f. We shall encounter later\nseveral important cases in which the existence of a ﬁxed point can b e established. We\ndeﬁne\nFixf:={x∈D|f(x) =x},\nthe set of all ﬁxed points of f.\nLet the set Dand the mapping f:D→Dbe given. A subset SofDis said to be\nstable under f, orf-stable for short, if f>(S)⊂S. We note that d∈Dis a ﬁxed\npoint offif and only if {d}is stable under f; this observation is used to derive Part\n(b) from Part (a) in the following proposition.\n26A. P ROPOSITION.

Constants\nMappings of a very simple kind are the constants, that is, mappings t hat have the\nsame value at all members of the domain. More formally, a mapping f:D→Cis\nsaid to be constant , and is called a constant (mapping) , if\n(Const): ∀x,x/prime∈D, f (x) =f(x/prime).\nObvious equivalent variants of this deﬁniens are:\n(Const 1): Part f is{D}(when D /negationslash= Ø) or Ø(whenD= Ø).\n(Const 2): Rngfis a singleton (when D /negationslash= Ø) or Ø(whenD= Ø).\nGiven the sets DandCandc∈C, the mapping f:D→Cdeﬁned by the rule\nf(x) :=cfor allx∈Dis a constant, since f<({c}) =D; it is denoted by cD→C. Every\nconstant other than 1 Øis of this form. In many contexts it would be pedantic to use\ndiﬀerent symbols for a constant and its only value; but the concept ual distinction\nmust always be kept in mind; thus cD→Cis often abbreviated to cif confusion is\nunlikely. We make a trivial remark: If D/negationslash= Ø andf:D→Cis constant, then\nf=f(d)D→Cfor eachd∈D; and ifC/negationslash= Ø, then 1 Ø⊂C=cØ→Cfor everyc∈C.

PROPERTIES OF MAPPINGS\n32. Injective, surjective, and bijective\nmappings\nConsider a given mapping f:D→C. In Section 23, we discussed the notion of\nsolution of equation (23.1), i.e.,\n(32.1) ? x∈D, f (x) =c\nwherec∈Cis given. We observe that the set of all solutions of (32.1) is precisely\nf<({c}). If equation (32.1) has solutions, i.e., if f<({c})/negationslash= Ø, or, equivalently c∈\nRngf, it is usual to say that (32.1) has at least one solution ; the problem of\nascertaining whether this is the case was called an existence problem in Section 23.\nIf, on the other hand, the set f<({c}) of solutions of (32.1) is either empty or a\nsingleton, it is usual to say that (32.1) has at most one solution ; and the problem\nof ascertaining whether this is the case is called a uniqueness problem . If the set\nf<({c}) of solutions of (32.1) is actually a singleton, one says that (32.1) has exactly\none solution , or, less aptly, that (32.1) has a unique solution .\nIn this section we discuss properties of a mapping fthat ensure an aﬃrmative\nanswer to the existence problem, to the uniqueness problem, or to both, for equation\n(32.1) no matter how c∈Cis chosen. One of these properties, namely surjectivity,\nwas already introduced in Section 23.\nIn this and subsequent sections, many propositions come in pairs, o r even triples,\nof analogues; the propositions in the same pair or triple are given the same designation\nwith a distinguishing addition, namely L (“left”), R (“right”), and, if n ecessary, B\n(“bilateral”).\nA mapping f:D→Cis said to be injective , and is called an injection , if it\nsatisﬁes the following condition:\n(Inj): ∀x,x/prime∈D, f (x) =f(x/prime)⇒x=x/prime.\nObvious equivalent variants of this deﬁniens are:\n(Inj 1):∀y∈C, f<({y})is empty or a singleton .\n(Inj 2):Foreveryc ∈C, theequation ?x∈D, f (x) =chasatmostonesolution .\n(Inj 3): Partf={{x} |x∈D}, the discrete partition of D .\nA mapping f:D→Cis said to be surjective , and is called a surjection (cf.\nSection 23), if it satisﬁes the following condition:\n(Surj): ∀y∈C,∃x∈D, f (x) =y.\nObvious equivalent variants of this deﬁniens are:\n(Surj 1):∀y∈C, f<({y})/negationslash= Ø.\n(Surj 2):Foreveryc ∈C, theequation ?x∈D,f(x) =chasatleastonesolution.\n(Surj 3): Rngf=C.\nA mapping f:D→Cis said to be bijective , and is called a bijection , if it\nsatisﬁes the following condition:\n(Bij):fis both injective and surjective .\nApril 17, 2014 11:57 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 45\n32.

For every z∈Rng(g◦f)⊂Rngg, the setg<({z}) is a singleton, hence\n(g◦f)<({z}) =f<(g<({z}))∈Partf. We have shown that Part( g◦f)⊂Partf.\nSince both collections are partitions of D, they are equal (Proposition 18B).\n32C.R. P ROPOSITION .Let the mappings f:D→Candg:C→Bbe given.

Sincey∈Cwas arbitrary, we conclude that Rng g⊂\nRng(g◦f). The reverse inclusion is valid by (25.3).\n32D.

The concept of a family\nWe are well acquainted with the notion of a sequence: a sequence of numbers,\nsay, is given by some rule that determines what number comes in the nth place, for\neachn∈N(orn∈N×, for those who prefer to count from 1). The natural number\nnis thought of as a label, an index , and the number in the nth place as the nth\nterm of the sequence. We must resist the urge to consider a sequence a s some kind\nof inﬁnite set, or as an “ordered set”: apart from the basic conce ptual diﬀerences\ninvolved here, the mere fact that one and the same number may app ear as thenth\nterm of the sequence for more than one n∈N(indeed, perhaps for all n ∈N)\nshould prevent such a confusion. There is much more to be said for t he view that a\nsequence of numbers is a special kind of mapping: one whose domain is N. One must\nmerely make the right translation: the index set Nbecomes the domain, the nth term\nbecomes the value at n.\nMore generally, any unambiguous method that allows us to associate with each\nmemberiof a given set Ian objectaidetermines a familya(deﬁned) on the set\nI, called the index set ; for eachi∈I, the object aiis called the term of index i,\nor theith term, of the familya. In a manner similar to that used for mappings, the\nfamiliesaandb, with respective index sets IandJ, are the same family if and only\nifI=Jandai=bifor alli∈I. In some contexts, notations such as a(i),ai, etc.,\nare used instead of ai. A family is said to be empty ornon-empty according as its\nindex set is empty or non-empty.\nOne often uses the notation ( ai|i∈I) for a family, especially when no explicit\nname for the family itself is available; thus, for instance, ( n3|n∈N) denotes a family.\n(Note the use of parentheses, not braces.)\nThe set of all the terms of a family ais called the range ofa, and is denoted by\nRngaor by{ai|i∈I}, whereIis the index set:\nRnga:={ai|i∈I}:∗={x|x=aifor somei∈I}.\n51\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 62\n52 CHAPTER 4. FAMILIES\nIfais a family and Ais a set such that Rng a⊂A, one says that ais afamily inA,\nor afamily of members of A.\nWe observe that the concept of a family is almost identical to that of a mapping,\nwith the following short glossary:\nindex set domain\nith term, term of index ivalue ati\n(ai|i∈I) ( i/mapsto→ai) :I→\nExcept for the matter of the presence or absence of a codomain, to be discussed a\nlittle later, there is no formal need to maintain a separate concept o f family and\nthe associated terminology. It must be said, however, that the tw o “languages”, of\nmappings and families, “sound” diﬀerent to the mathematician, sugg esting diﬀerent\nassociations of ideas, and that both are used profusely; it is there fore necessary to\nbecome ﬂuent in both.\nWe note that in our description of the concept of family there was no thing corre-\nsponding to the codomain of a mapping. It is most nearly consistent w ith the common\nusage concerning families to regard them as unprovided with a codom ain (or, in some\nintuitive sense, as having “everything” as the codomain); not all ma thematicians\nwould agree. We should like, however, to make use of the terminology and notations\nintroduced for mappings when dealing with families; as well as to pay so me respect to\nOccam’s Razor ( entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem ; roughly, Concepts\nshould not be multiplied beyond need). For formal purposes, we may therefore make\na family into a mapping by providing it with a “formal” codomain: for this r ole we\nselect, for lack of a better choice, the range of the family. We thus have the following\ndeﬁnition, which supersedes, in a purely formal sense, the preced ing discussion: A\nfamily is deﬁned to be a surjective mapping. The terminology and notation n ot\ncovered by the preceding glossary will be accounted for by this deﬁ nition, with the\nfollowing amendments: If a:= (ai|i∈I) is a family and Ais a set, we deﬁne the\npre-image of Aunderaeven when Ais not included in Rng a:\na<(A) :={i∈I|ai∈A}=a<(A∩Rnga);\nand in any composition involving a family — at most one will appear, the ot her\ningredients being mappings — its codomain is adjusted as needed to an y set that\nincludes its range, while the composite is again regarded as a family. As a case in\npoint, ifJ⊂I, the restriction to Jof the family ( ai|i∈I) is the family ( ai|i∈J).\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 63\n42. Special families 53\n42. Special families\nFor some kinds of index set, special terminology is used. If n∈N, a family deﬁned\nonn⊏:={0,...,n −1}or onn⊐:={1,...,n }(formal deﬁnitions of these sets will be\ngiven later) is called a list of length n. (A common barbarism for this is “ n-tuple”;\na term often used is (ﬁnite) sequence of length n.) If the length is small, a list amay\nbe denoted by ( ) ,(a1),(a1,a2),(a1,a2,a3), and so on, according to the length. A\nfamily deﬁned on Nor onN×:=N\\{0}is called a sequence .\nIfI,Jare sets, a family deﬁned on I×Jis called an I×J-matrix . The term of\nindex (i,j) of anI×J-matrixMis called its ( i,j)-entry , and is usually written Mi,j\nor evenMij, instead of M(i,j). For each i∈I, the family ( Mi,j|j∈J) is called the\nith row of the matrix M, and for each j∈Jthe family ( Mi,j|i∈I) is called the\njth column of M. TheJ×I-matrixM/latticetop:=M◦/latticetopJ×I, satisfying ( M/latticetop)j,i=Mi,jfor\nall (j,i)∈J×I, is called the transpose of M, and is said to be obtained from M\nbytransposition . Ifm,n∈N, anm⊏×n⊏-matrix or an m⊐×n⊐-matrix is called\nanm-by-n-matrix . Ifmandnare small, the familiar bookkeeping scheme may be\nused: e.g.,\nM=:/parenleftbiggM1,1M1,2M1,3\nM2,1M2,2M2,3/parenrightbigg\n.\nTheI×J-matrixMis said to be a square matrix ifI=J. In this case, Mis\nsaid to be symmetric ifM/latticetop=M, i.e., ifMj,i=Mi,jfor all (i,j)∈I×I. IfMis a\n(square)I×I-matrix, the family ( Mi,i|ı∈I) is called the diagonal of M.\nAlthough families and sets must not be confused, we often wish to co nsider the\nfamily (x|x∈S), whereSis a given set; formally, this is just the identity mapping\n1S. It is a commonly accepted license to call this the familySor, more fully, the set\nSself-indexed (as a family) , and to use for it the same symbol Sas for the set.\nLetSbe a set and Ua subset of S. The family χU⊂Sdeﬁned onSby\nχU⊂S(x) :=/braceleftbigg1 ifx∈U\n0 ifx∈S\\U\nis called the characteristic family of U(inS), or the characteristic function of\nU(inS) when a codomain — usually R, sometimes the doubleton {0,1}orNor the\ninterval [0,1] — is speciﬁed. When the domain (index set) Sis ﬁxed throughout a\ndiscussion, the notation is frequently abbreviated to χU.\n42A. P ROPOSITION .Let the set Sbe given.

Lists of length 2 (with index set 2⊐={1,2}, say) may be identiﬁed with\npairs, the 1st term becoming the former component of the pair, an d the 2nd term\nbecoming the latter component of the pair.

(a): Propositions 46A and 46B together show that the Cartesian\nproduct×\ni∈IAiand the family of projections ( πi|i∈I) constitute “the essentially\nunique” product of the family of sets ( Ai|i∈I). The abstract concept of set-product\nis nevertheless useful. At the same time, the use of the term “prod uct”, chosen for\nthe allusion to the Cartesian product, should not lead to confusion. The special\nproduct described in Proposition 44B may be called the Cartesian product , or the\nstandard product , or simply theproduct, of(Ai|i∈I).\n(b): IfIandAare given sets, the set Map( I,A), together with the family of\nevaluations ( a/mapsto→a(i)|i∈I)∈×\ni∈IMap(Map(I,A),A), is a product of the family\n(A|i∈I). IfAandBare given sets, the set A×Btogether with the pair of\nmappings ((( x,y)/mapsto→x) :A×B→A),((x,y)/mapsto→y) :A×B→B)) is a product of\nthe pair (A,B) (where pairs are identiﬁed with lists of length 2).\nThe following proposition could be proved by using Propositions 46A an d 46B,\ntogether with our knowledge of the Cartesian product. We prefer to show how it can\nbe obtained directly from the deﬁnition of product.\n46D.

Proof of (a). Letx,y∈Pbe given, and assume that pi(x) =pi(y) for all\ni∈I. Choose a non-empty set B(e.g., a singleton). Then pi◦xB→P=pi(x)B→Ai=\npi(y)B→Ai=pi◦yB→Pfor alli∈I. By the uniqueness condition in the deﬁnition of\nproduct, we must have xB→P=yB→P. SinceB/negationslash= Ø, this implies x=y. The reverse\nimplication is trivial.\nProof of (b). Letj∈Ibe given.

Relations in a set\nConsider the statement “6 is a multiple of 3”. It is clear that if we repla ce “6”\nand “3” by any (names for) natural numbers we again obtain a mean ingful statement.\nThus “mis a multiple of n” is meaningful whenever mandnare members of the set\nNof natural numbers. Of course, whether “ mis a multiple of n” is a true statement\ndepends on what numbers mandnactually are. The sentence fragment “is a multiple\nof” determines a relation in the set Nof all natural numbers. Similarly, the sentence\nfragments “does not exceed” and “is less than or equal to”, both usually abbreviated\n“≤”, determine one and the same relation in the set Rof all real numbers. The\nfragment becomes a complete assertion, or statement, when pre ceded and followed\nby names of real numbers. For instance, “Two does not exceed on e”, or “2 ≤1”, is\na complete, meaningful statement; it happens to be false.\nIn general, a relationρina setDis determined by a two-place predicate in\nwhich both places can be ﬁlled only with members of D. Ifx,y∈Dﬁll these places,\nrespectively, the resulting assertion is usually written x ρ y , with the symbol for the\nrelation between the symbols for xandy. The setDis called the domain of ρ, and\nis denoted by Dom ρ:=D.\nPredicates that yield equivalent assertions when ﬁlled with the same p air of mem-\nbers of the same set are regarded as determining the same relation. Thus, if ρandσ\nare relations, we have ρ=σif and only if\nD:= Domρ= Domσ and ∀x,y∈D, x ρ y ⇔x σ y.\nWith each relation ρin the setDwe associate a subset Gr ρ, called the graph of\nρ, of the product set D×D, as follows:\nGrρ:={(x,y)∈D×D|x ρ y}.\nConversely, it is clear that every subset GofD×Dis the graph of exactly one relation\ninD: namely, the relation ρdeﬁned by the rule\n71\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 82\n72 CHAPTER 5.

For ins tance, in the space\nof ordinary Euclidean geometry, we may consider assertions such a s “the plane Pis\nperpendicular to the line l”. Here the places in the predicate “is perpendicular to”\nare to be ﬁlled with (the name of) a plane and (the name of) a line, resp ectively.\nWe therefore consider the concept of a relationρfrom the setDtothe setC,\nin which the places in the predicate determining the relation are to be ﬁ lled with a\nmember of Dand a member of C, respectively. Dis called the domain of ρ, andC\nthecodomain of ρ. A relation from DtoDis then a relation in Das described in\nSection 51.\nAll the concepts introduced in Sections 51, 52, and 53 have their ob vious general-\nizations to relations form set to set, and obey the same rules. Thus , ifρis a relation\nfromDtoC, the graph Grρis a subset of D×C, the induced mappings are\nρ>:P(D)→P(C) andρ<:P(C)→P(D), and reversal of ρproduces the reverse\nρ←, a relation from CtoD.\nOne can compose relations ρandσto form the composite σ◦ρonly when the\ndomain ofσis the codomain of ρ.\nLet the mapping f:D→Cbe given. To this mapping we associate the relation\nf/mapsto→fromDtoCdeﬁned by the rule\n∀(x,y)∈D×C, xf/mapsto→y:⇔y=f(x).\nWe note the following obvious rules satisﬁed by the relationf/mapsto→:\n(54.1) Grf/mapsto→= Grf,\n(54.2) (f/mapsto→)>=f> (f/mapsto→)<=f<.\nIf the mappings f:D→Candg:C→Bare given, then\n(54.3)g/mapsto→ ◦f/mapsto→=g◦f/mapsto−→.\nWe observe that, for every set D, the equality relation = DinDdeﬁned in Section\n51 is precisely1D/mapsto−→.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 87\n54.

Order\nAmong the properties of relations introduced in the preceding sect ion there are\nsome particularly important combinations. We discuss these in this se ction and the\nnext.\nA relation in a set is called an order if it is transitive, antisymmetric, and re-\nﬂexive; it is called a strict-order if it is transitive and irreﬂexive, and hence also\nstrictly antisymmetric (Remarks 55B,(g)). If the distinction from s trict-orders is to\nbe stressed, an order may be called a lax order . It follows from Proposition 55C\nthat the reverse and each restriction of an order is again an order ; an analogous as-\nsertion follows for strict-orders. It is customary to denote an or der or a strict-order\nby≺, <, /triangleleft, ⊏, or another symbol of a similar shape. If such a symbol is used, its\nleft-to-right mirror image is used to denote the reverse relation.\nThere is an obvious correspondence between orders and strict-o rders in a given\nset, exempliﬁed by the relationship between the order ≤and the strict-order <inR\n(Examples 55D,(b)). These relations diﬀer only by the inclusion or exc lusion, respec-\ntively, of equality; to put it another way, by the inclusion or exclusion , respectively,\nof the diagonal in or from the graph. More formally, the correspon dence is described\nby the following result.\n56A. P ROPOSITION .LetDbe a given set. Then :\n(a): For each order ≺inD, deﬁne the relation /precedenotslnteqlinDby the rule\n∀x,y∈D, x /precedenotslnteqly:⇔(x≺yandx/negationslash=y)\n(i.e., Gr(/precedenotslnteql) := Gr( ≺)\\/triangleD)). Then /precedenotslnteqlis a strict order .\n(b): for each strict-order ≺inD, deﬁne the relation /precedesequalinDby the rule\n∀x,y∈D, x /precedesequaly:⇔(x≺y or x =y)\ni.e.,Gr(/precedesequal) := Gr( ≺)∪ /triangle D). Then /precedesequalis an order .\n(c): The mapping ≺/mapsto→/precedenotslnteqlfrom the set of all orders in Dto the set of all strict-\norders inD, and the mapping ≺/mapsto→/precedesequal from the set of all strict-orders in Dto the set\nof all orders in D, are inverses of each other.\n(d): If≺is an order in D, then ≺is total if and only if /precedenotslnteqlis total, and this is the\ncase if and only if\n∀x,y∈D, x /precedenotslnteqly⇔(not x/followsy).\nProposition 56A allows us to use the expressions “an order and the corresponding\nstrict-order”, “a strict-order and the corresponding (lax) order” unambiguously. Note\nthat this correspondence is preserved under reversal and rest riction. When dealing\nwith this kind of relation, it is often useful to have both the order an d the correspond-\ning strict-order available, and it is a matter of expediency whether o ne considers the\none or the other as primary. It is usually more convenient to work wit h the (lax)\norder.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 91\n56. Order 81\n56B. E XAMPLES . (a)∗: The relations ≤and<inR(as well as their respective\nrestrictions to, say N) are an order and the corresponding strict-order, respectively .\nThey are total.\n(b)∗: The relation “divides” in N(usually abbreviated to “ |”) is an order; it is not\ntotal (Example 55D,(c)).\n(c)∗: In the example of a model of a human population (Example 55D,(d)), the\nrelation “is a descendant of” is a strict-order; it is usually not total.\n(d): The most important example of an order is the inclusion relation ⊂Sin\nthe power-set P(S) of a given set S, deﬁned by the rule\n∀U,V∈P(S), U⊂SV:⇔U⊂V.\nThe corresponding strict-order is the proper-inclusion relation /subsetornotdbleqlS. These relations\nare not total, unless Sis empty or a singleton.\n(e): Let the set Dbe given. If ρandσare relations in D, thenρis said to be\nnarrower than σ, andσis said to be broader than ρ, if\n∀x,y∈D, x ρ y ⇒x σ y.\nThis condition is obviously equivalent to Gr ρ⊂Grσ. Since the inclusion relation\n⊂D×Dis an order in P(D×D) (see (d)), it follows that the relation “is narrower\nthan” is an order in the set of all relations in D, and “is broader than” is its reverse.\nAs noted in Proposition 56A,(d), an order is total if and only if the cor responding\nstrict-order is total. If ≺is an order or a strict-order in a set D, then the members\nx,y∈Dare said to be ≺-comparable if eitherx≺yory≺xorx=y. Thus\nthe order or strict-order ≺is total if and only if xandyare≺-comparable for all\nx,y∈D. Some mathematicians prefer to use the term partial order instead of order ,\nto indicate that there may be non-comparable pairs of members of t he domain. In\nthe older literature, the term order is often used to mean what we have called total\norder . Our usage reﬂects the increasingly prevalent view that (partial) o rder is a more\nfundamental concept than total order.\nA set with a speciﬁed order in it is an important mathematical object in its own\nright; we shall devote three entire chapters to ordered sets .\nApril 17, 2014 14:48 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 92\n82 CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS\n57. Equivalence relations\nLet the set Dand a mapping fwith Domf=Dbe given. Deﬁne the relation ρ\ninDby the rule\n∀x,y∈D, x ρ y :⇔f(x) =f(y).\nIt is an immediate consequence of the logical properties of equality t hatρis reﬂexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive. We shall see later that these propertie s are characteristic,\ni.e., that every reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive relation ρinDis obtained in\nthis manner from a suitable mapping fwith Domf=D(Corollary 57G). For this\nreason, we call such relations equivalence relations (“equivalent” means “having the\nsame value”).\nThus, a relation in a set is called an equivalence relation if it is reﬂexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive. In addition to the examples that may be o btained by the\nprocess described above, we mention a few others.\n57A. E XAMPLES . (a): In every set D, the equality relation = Dand the trivial\nrelation whose graph is D×Dare equivalence relations.\n(b)∗: IfD,C are given sets, the relation ∼in Map(D,C ) deﬁned by the rule\n∀f,g∈Map(D,C ), f∼g:⇔ {x∈D|f(x)/negationslash=g(x)}is a ﬁnite set\nis an equivalence relation. (To prove this, we use the facts that Ø is a ﬁnite set and\nthat every subset of the union of two ﬁnite sets is a ﬁnite set.)\n(c)∗: Deﬁne the relation ∼inN×Nby the rule\n∀(m,n),(m/prime,n/prime)∈N×N,(m,n)∼(m/prime,n/prime) :⇔m+n/prime=m/prime+n.\nThen∼is an equivalence relation.\n(d)∗: Letm∈Zbe given, and deﬁne the relation ≡minZby the rule\n∀n,n/prime∈Z, n≡mn/prime:⇔mdividesn/prime−n\n(the deﬁniendum is usually written “ n≡n/prime(modm)”). Then ≡m, which is called\ncongruence modulo m, is an equivalence relation.\nIn characterizing equivalence relations, it is sometimes convenient t o combine the\ndeﬁnitions of symmetry and transitivity into a single formula resemblin g the deﬁnition\nof transitivity alone.\n57B.

By Proposition 57B\nwe havey ρ u, i.e.,u∈ρ>({y}). Sinceu∈ρ>({x}) was arbitrary, it follows that\nρ>({x})⊂ρ>({y}). Interchanging x,yin the preceding argument, we conclude that\nthe reverse inclusion holds, so that ρ>({x}) =ρ>({y}).\nIn the following theorem, Pis a partition of D, and ΩP:D→ P is the corre-\nsponding partition mapping (Section 24).\n57D.

We ﬁrst show that ≺satisﬁes (57.2). Let A,B∈ P be given, and\nassume that A≺B. Letx∈Aandy∈Bbe given. By (57.1) we may choose\nx/prime∈Aandy/prime∈Bsuch thatx/primeσ y/prime. Nowx,x/prime∈A∈ P, and hence x ρ x/prime, which\nimpliesx σ x/prime; similarly, we have y ρ y/prime, which implies y/primeσ y. Sinceσis transitive,\nwe conclude that x σ y . The reverse implication in (57.2) follows from (57.1), since\nneitherAnorBis empty. (57.3) is a reformulation of (57.2).\nSince no member of Pis empty, and since σis reﬂexive, ≺is also reﬂexive.

Basic Concepts\nA setDendowed with structure by the prescription of an order ≺inDis called\nanordered set ; more speciﬁcally, the set Dordered by ≺. It is denoted simply\nbyD, or, if for some reason the order must be made explicit, by ( D;≺). Together\nwith the order ≺we also have the corresponding strict-order /precedenotslnteqlinD. An ordered\nset (D;≺) is unambiguously speciﬁed by prescribing a strict-order in the set Dand\nrequiring that this strict-order be /precedenotslnteql(cf. Proposition 56A). An ordered set is said to\nbetotally ordered if its order is total, and we speak of the set Dtotally ordered\nby≺.\nLet the set Dordered by ≺be given. Every subset SofDis naturally endowed\nwith the structure of an ordered set by the restriction ≺|Sof≺toS. The setS\nordered by ≺|Sis called an ordered subset of D(the term should be “sub-ordered-\nset”, but this is stylistically inadmissible). When confusion is unlikely, we refer to\nthis ordered subset simply as S, or asSordered by ≺. IfDis totally ordered, every\nordered subset is totally ordered. If the ordered subset Sis totally ordered (even\nthoughDmight not be), Sis called a chain ofD.\nWe introduce a collection of concepts concerning the structure of an ordered set.\nThese concepts will be illustrated in Examples 61D. Throughout this s ection we con-\nsider a given set Dordered by ≺.\nLetx,y∈Dbe given. If x≺y, we say that xprecedesy, and thatyfollows\nx.

It\nis again important to distinguish carefully between maximum and maxima l member,\nand between minimum and minimal member. For instance, a subset of Dmay have\nmaximal members, but fail to have a maximum (Examples 61D,(a),(c),( d),(e)): it is\nquite easy to exhibit one such example with a single maximal member. All of this\ncannot occur, however, if the order is total, and the reverse situ ation is altogether\nimpossible.\n61C. P ROPOSITION .Let the ordered set Dand the subset AofDbe given. Then:\n(a): IfAhas a maximum [minimum] then maxA[minA] is the unique maximal\n[minimal] member of A.\n(b): If the order is total, then a member of Ais a maximal [minimal] member of\nA(if and) only if it is the maximum [minimum] of A.\n(c): IfAis coﬁnal [coinitial] in D, then a member of Ais a maximal [minimal]\nmember of Aif and only if it is a maximal [minimal] member of D.\n(d): IfUb(A)has an inﬁmum [ Lb(A)has a supremum], then that inﬁmum [supre-\nmum] is the supremum [inﬁmum] of A.\n(e): A member of Ub(A)[ofLb(A)] is a maximal member of Ub(A)[a minimal\nmember of Lb(A)] if and only if it is a maximal [minimal] member of D.\n61D.

Basic Concepts 91\nthe usual order ≤. This is a totally ordered set. The order-intervals [ [ s,t] ], etc., are\nthe usual intervals [ s,t], etc., in P. Ifs,t∈Psatisfys < t , the sets [s,t] and ]s,t]\nhave a maximum, namely t, but [s,t[ and ]s,t[ have none. Pitself has no maximum,\nwhile min P= 0; but P×:=P\\{0}has no minimum. It is a consequence of the\nfundamental properties of the Real-Number System that every n on-empty subset of\nPhas an inﬁmum (e.g., inf] s,t] =sifs < t, inf{1\nn|n∈N×}= 0), and every\nsubset of Pthat has some upper bound actually has a supremum (e.g., sup {r∈P|r\nrational,r2<2}=√\n2,supPØ = 0).\n(c)∗: Consider the set Nordered by the relation “divides”. Let the subset Aof\nNbe given. The upper bounds of Aare the common multiples of A, and the lower\nbounds ofAare the common divisors of A. The subset Aalways has a supremum,\ncalled the least common multiple of Aand denoted by lcm A: namely, lcm A= 0 if\n0∈AorAis inﬁnite; lcm A= 1 ifA= Ø; and lcm Ais the usual least common\nmultiple otherwise. Aalso always has an inﬁmum, called the greatest common divisor\nofA, and denoted by gcd A: namely, gcd A= 0 ifA= Ø orA={0}, and gcdAis the\nusual greatest common divisor otherwise. However, if A⊂N×, Ahas a supremum\nwith respect to N×if and only if Ais ﬁnite, and an inﬁmum with respect to N×if\nand only if Ais not empty. Every non-empty subset of Nhas minimal members;\nin particular, the minimal members of N×\\{1}are the prime numbers. The special\nterminology mentioned in this example serves to prevent confusion w ith the concepts\nassociated with the set N(totally) ordered by the usual order ≤.\n(d): Every set Dcan trivially be endowed with the structure of an ordered set by\nprescribing the equality relation = Das the order. In this ordered set, every member\nof a subset is both a maximal and a minimal member. A subset has a max imum, a\nminimum, a supremum, or an inﬁmum only when it is a singleton; the sole ex ception\nis that, when Ditself is a singleton, the empty set also has a supremum and an\ninﬁmum.\n(e): Let the set Sbe given, and consider the collection P(S) ordered by ⊂S. This\nordered set is not totally ordered unless Sis empty or a singleton. Every subcollection\nUofP(S) has a supremum and an inﬁmum, namely/uniondisplay\nUand/intersectiondisplay\nSU, respectively, as\nis easily veriﬁed. For U,V∈P(S), the subcollection {U,V}has neither maximum\nnor minimum unless U⊂VorV⊂U. The minimal members of P×(S) are the\nsingletons of S.\n(f): More generally, let a collection of sets Dbe given. In D, the relation “is\nincluded in”, deﬁned by set-inclusion, is an order. The ordered set s o obtained is\ncalled the collection Dordered by inclusion ; it may be regarded as an ordered\nsubset of P(/uniondisplay\nD) ordered by ⊂/uniontextD. InDordered by inclusion, we may use the\nterms largest member andsmallest member instead of maximum andminimum ,\nrespectively. If Dis totally ordered by inclusion, Dis called a nest.\n(g): Let the set Dbe given. In Example 56B,(e) we deﬁned the order “narrower\nthan” in the set of all relations in D, by specifying that, for given relations ρand\nσinD, ρ is said to be narrower than σif Grρ⊂Grσ; this is thus essentially a\nspecial case of (e), with S:=D×D.

ORDERED SETS\nrelations in Dordered by “narrower than” is Ord( D), the set of all orders inD. The\nnext result characterizes the maximal members of Ord( D).\n61E. P ROPOSITION .Let the setDbe given. An order ρinDis a maximal member\nofOrd(D), ordered by the order “narrower than”, if and only if ρis a total order.\nProof . The “if” part follows immediately from the fact that every member o f\nOrd(D) is an antisymmetric relation.\nTo prove the “only if” part by contraposition, let the order ρ∈Ord(D) be given,\nand assume that ρis not total. Choose a,b∈Dsuch thataandbare not\nρ-comparable, and deﬁne the relation σinDby\n∀x,y∈D, x σ y :⇔(x ρ y or (x ρ a andb ρ y )).\nThis relation is obviously reﬂexive, and it is easily veriﬁed that σis also antisymmetric\nand transitive, hence σ∈Ord(D). Moreover, ρis clearly narrower than σ; sincea\nandbare notρ-comparable, we have ( a,b)∈Grσ\\Grρ, and we conclude that ρis\nstrictly narrower than σ. Henceρis not a maximal member of Ord( D).\n61F. R EMARK . Together with the set Dordered by ≺we may also consider the\nsame setDordered by the reverse order /follows. IfAis a subset of D, the upper bounds of A\ninDordered by ≺are the lower bounds of AinDordered by /follows, and vice versa. In the\nsame manner, when the order is reversed, bounded from above be comes bounded from\nbelow, coﬁnal becomes coinitial, maximum becomes minimum, supremum becomes\ninﬁmum, and maximal members become minimal members, of A; and vice versa. This\nobservation allows us to cut in half many proofs and indeed statemen ts, such as those\nof Propositions 61A, 61B, and 61C. This will be carried out as follows. A proposition\nmay have an arrow ↑added to its designation. This indicates that another proposition\nmay be obtained from it, on account of this remark, by replacing “up per bound” by\n“lower bound” and vice versa, and making the other interchanges m entioned before.\nThis other proposition is not stated , but may be quoted by the same designation with\nan arrow ↓added instead.\nSince the reverse of a total order is a total order, this remark ex tends to proposi-\ntions concerning totally ordered sets.\nAn example of the convention in Remark 61F is the following technical r esult.\n61G↑.

For each\nf∈Isot(D,D/prime) we have the question: Is there g∈Isot(D/prime,D) such that g◦f= 1 D\nandf◦g= 1D/prime? The existence of such a gplainly requires fto be an invertible, or\nequivalently, a bijective, mapping; and if this is the case, any such gmust be precisely\nf←. The answer to the question is therefore aﬃrmative if and only if fis an invertible\nmapping and f←∈Isot(D/prime,D); equivalently, if and only if fis bijective and\n(62.1) ∀x,y∈D, x ≺y⇔f(x)≺/primef(y).\nIf these conditions are satisﬁed, fis called an order-isomorphism from DtoD/prime.\nObviously, if fis an order-isomorphism, so is f←. We say that the ordered set Dis\norder-isomorphic to the ordered set D/prime, or thatDandD/primeare order-isomorphic ,\nif there exists an order-isomorphism from DtoD/prime.\nIt should be noted that an isotone mapping may be bijective and yet f ail to be an\norder-isomorphism. For instance, choose an set Dordered by some order ≺distinct\nfrom the equality relation = D(such an order can be found unless Dis empty or a sin-\ngleton). Then 1 D∈Isot((D; =D),(D;≺)), but (1 D)←= 1 D/∈Isot((D;≺),(D; =D)).\nThis situation is ruled out, however, if the domain of the bijection is to tally ordered.\n62D.

ORDERED SETS\n64. Properties of ordered sets\nThe order of an ordered set may have some useful special proper ties. One instance\nis totality; totally ordered sets have already been considered in the preceding sections.\nWe mention a few other properties in this section.\nLet the set Dordered by ≺be given. If for all x,y∈Dthere is a member of D\nthat follows both xandy, i.e., if Ub( {x,y})/negationslash= Ø for all x,y∈D, then the ordered\nsetDis called a directed set ; speciﬁcally, the set Ddirected by ≺. If{x,y}has\nboth a supremum and inﬁmum for all x,y∈D, the ordered set Dis called a lattice ,\nand the order ≺is called a lattice-order . Every totally ordered set is a lattice, and\nevery lattice is a directed set. If ≺is a lattice-order, so is the reverse order /follows. These\nconcepts will not be discussed any further at this time. We shall, how ever, devote\nthe entire next chapter to ordered sets with a property stronge r than that of being\na lattice: a set Dordered by ≺is said to be completely ordered (by≺) ifevery\nsubset ofDhas both a supremum and an inﬁmum. A completely ordered set is also\ncalled a complete lattice .\nA setDordered by ≺is said to be well-founded (by≺) if every non-empty\nsubset ofDhas at least one minimal member. This kind of ordered set is related to\nthe notions of “proof by induction” and “recursive deﬁnition” that will be discussed\nat length in Chapter 8. Finally, a set Dordered by ≺is said to be well-ordered\n(by≺) if every non-empty subset of Dhas a minimum. We note that every ordered\nsubset of a well-founded [well-ordered] set is also well-founded [well-o rdered].\n64A. P ROPOSITION .An ordered set is well-ordered if and only if it is both totall y\nordered and well-founded.\nProof . An ordered set is totally ordered if and only if every doubleton includ ed in\nit has a minimum. The assertion then follows from Proposition 61C.\n64B. P ROPOSITION .Let the ordered set DandD/primebe given. If D/primeis well-founded\nand there exists at least one strictly isotone mapping from DtoD/prime, thenDis also\nwell-founded.\nProof . This follows at once from Proposition 62C ↓,(d).\n64C. P ROPOSITION .The product of a pair of well-founded sets is well-founded.\nProof . Let ((A/prime;≺/prime),(A/prime/prime;≺/prime/prime)) be a pair of well-founded sets, and let ≺be the\nproduct order in A/prime×A/prime/prime, deﬁned by (63.3). Let the non-empty subset BofA/prime×A/prime/prime\nbe given. Choose a minimal member m/primeof the non-empty subset\n{x/prime∈A/prime| ∃x/prime/prime∈A/prime/prime,(x/prime,x/prime/prime)∈B}ofA/prime, and choose a minimal member m/prime/primeof\nthe non-empty subset {x/prime/prime∈A/prime/prime|(m/prime,x/prime/prime)∈B}ofA/prime/prime. Then (m/prime,m/prime/prime) is a minimal\nmember of Bin the product A/prime×A/prime/primeordered by ≺.\n64D. P ROPOSITION .Let the ordered set Dand the collection Cof ordered subsets\nofDbe given.

(a): For every set S, the collection P(S) is completely ordered\nby inclusion (Example 61D,(e)).∗We mention that P(S) is well-founded by inclusion\nif and only if Sis a ﬁnite set (Section 102).\n(b)∗: The set Rordered by ≤is totally ordered. It is neither completely ordered\nnor well-ordered, since it has no minimum. Its ordered subset P, though it has\na minimum, is neither completely ordered (it has no maximum) nor well-or dered\n(P×has no minimum). If s,t∈Rsatisfys < t , then the ordered subset [ s,t] is\ncompletely ordered, but not well-ordered. The ordered subset Nis well-ordered, but\nnot completely ordered (it has no maximum).\n(c)∗: The set Nordered by the relation “divides” is completely ordered (Example\n61D,(c)), but not totally ordered. The ordered subset N×is a lattice, but it is\nnot completely ordered (since it has no maximum). It is, however, we ll-founded,\nby Proposition 64B, since, as pointed out in Example 62G,(b), the map ping 1 N×is\nstrictly isotone from N×ordered by “divides” to N×well-ordered by ≤.\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 112\n102 CHAPTER 6.

For all x,y∈×\ni∈IAiwithx/negationslash=ywe may deﬁne\nk(x,y) := min {i∈I|xi/negationslash=yi}in the well-ordered set I.

Then lexis total if and only if ≺iis total for every\ni∈I.\nThe order lex in ×\ni∈IAiis called lexicographic order , and the ordered set\n(×\ni∈IAi; lex) is called the lexicographic product of the family (( Ai;≺i)|i∈I).\nFor a given pair of ordered spaces (( A/prime;≺/prime),(A/prime/prime;≺/prime/prime)), the appropriate variant\ndeﬁnition of the order lex in the product A/prime×A/prime/prime(yielding the lexicographic product\n(A/prime×A/prime/prime; lex)ofthe pair) is\n∀(x/prime,x/prime/prime),(y/prime,y/prime/prime)∈A/prime×A/prime/prime,(x/prime,x/prime/prime) lex (y/prime,y/prime/prime) :⇔\n⇔(x/prime/precedenotslnteql/primey/primeor (x/prime=y/primeandx/prime/prime≺/prime/primey/prime/prime)).\nThe following result is proved exactly like Proposition 64C.\n65B.

Completely ordered sets\nWe recall a deﬁnition from Section 64. A set Dordered by ≺is said to be\ncompletely ordered (by≺) if every subset of Dhas both a supremum and an\ninﬁmum.\n71A. R EMARKS . (a): IfDis a completely ordered set, then Dhas both a max-\nimum and a minimum, since supDD= maxDand inf DD= minD. In particular, D\nis not empty.\n(b): IfDis completely ordered by ≺, thenDis also completely ordered by the\nreverse order /follows. The convention introduced in Remark 61F is therefore in force for\npropositions concerning completely ordered sets.\n(c): For every set S, the collection P(S) is completely ordered by inclusion; the\nsupremum and inﬁmum of a subcollection UofP(S) are, respectively,/uniondisplay\nUand/intersectiondisplay\nSU\n(Examples 61D,(e) and 64E,(a)).\n(d): Let the set Dbe given. By (c), the collection P(D×D) is completely ordered\nby inclusion. Consequently, the set of all relations in Dis completely ordered by the\nrelation “narrower than” (Example 56B,(e)).\nIn deﬁning a completely ordered set we required that every subset have both a\nsupremum and an inﬁmum; it turns out that requiring the existence o f either would\nhave been enough.\n71B↑. PROPOSITION .An ordered set Dis completely ordered if (and only if)\nevery subset of Dhas a supremum .\nProof . Assume that every subset of Dhas a supremum. Let the subset AofDbe\ngiven, and set s:= sup Lb(A). By Proposition 61C,(d), sis the inﬁmum of A.\n71C. E XAMPLE .

The relation ⊏Sin Part(S), deﬁned by\nthe rule\n∀P,Q ∈ Part(S),P⊏SQ:⇔ P⊏Q\nis an order (see Proposition 18D). We shall now show that, in the colle ction Part(S)\nordered by ⊏S, every subcollection of Part( S) has a supremum. It will then follow\n105\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 116\n106 CHAPTER 7. COMPLETELY ORDERED SETS\nby Proposition 71B ↑that Part(S) is completely ordered by ⊏S.\nLet the subcollection Γ of Part( S) be given. We claim that the collection\nC:={/intersectiondisplay\nP∈ΓSΩP(x)|x∈S} ⊂P(S)\nis a partition of Sand that, in fact, Cis the supremum of Γ. For every x∈S, we\nhavex∈ΩP(x) for all P ∈ Γ, and hence x∈/intersectiondisplay\nP∈ΓSΩP(x). Therefore/uniondisplay\nC=Sand\nØ/∈ C. Letx,y∈Sbe given, and suppose that (/intersectiondisplay\nP∈ΓSΩP(x))∩(/intersectiondisplay\nP∈ΓSΩP(y))/negationslash= Ø.\nThen ΩP(x)∩ΩP(y)/negationslash= Ø, whence Ω P(x) = ΩP(y), for each P ∈ Γ. Therefore/intersectiondisplay\nP∈ΓSΩP(x) =/intersectiondisplay\nP∈ΓSΩP(y). Sincex,y∈Swere arbitrary, we conclude that Cis a\npartition of S.\nFor every Q ∈ Γ we have/intersectiondisplay\nP∈ΓSΩP(x)⊂ΩQ(x) for eachx∈S; hence Q⊏C.\nSinceQ ∈ Γ was arbitrary, we conclude that Cis an upper bound of Γ. On the other\nhand, suppose that the partition RofSis an upper bound of Γ. For each P ∈ Γ\nwe then have P⊏R, and therefore Ω R(x)⊂ΩP(x) for every x∈S. It follows that\nΩR(x)⊂/intersectiondisplay\nP∈ΓSΩP(x) for every x∈S, and therefore C⊏R. We conclude that Cis\nthe minimum of the upper bounds of Γ, i.e., the supremum of Γ.\n71D↑. PROPOSITION . (a): Let the family of completely ordered sets ((Ai;≺i)|i∈\nI)be given. Then its product is completely ordered. If Bis a subset of ×\ni∈IAi, then\nsupB= (sup(πi)>(B)|i∈I).\n(b): Let the set Sand the completely ordered set Dbe given. Then the set\nMap(S,D)is completely ordered by the valuewise order. If Fis a subset of Map(S,D),\nthen\n(supF)(s) = sup {f(s)|f∈F} for alls∈S.\nProof . This follows at once from Propositions 63D ↑,(c) and 71B ↑.\nLetDbe a completely ordered set, and Ea subset of D. There are some useful\ncriteria that ensure that the ordered subset Eis itself completely ordered. We give\none here (Proposition 71F); another will be found in Proposition 72E ,(b).\nA subsetEofDis said to be inﬁmum-stable if inf DA∈Efor every subset\nAofE. (This implies, in particular, that max D= inf DØ∈E, and inf DE∈E.)\nWhen the ordered set Dhappens to be P(S) ordered by inclusion, for some set S\n(Remark 71A,(c)), the term inﬁmum-stable may be replaced by the more speciﬁc term\nintersection-stable . Since inﬁmum-stable subsets of completely ordered sets occur\nwith great frequency in mathematics, it is convenient to learn how to make new ones\nout of given ones; one way is to construct intersections, as the ne xt proposition shows.\n71E.

Then the ordered subset Eis completely ordered, and\ninfEA= inf DAfor all subsets AofE.\nProof . For every subset AofE, we have inf DA∈E. By Proposition 61B,(b), A\nhas an inﬁmum with respect to E, and inf EA= inf DA. By Proposition 71B ↓, the\nordered subset Eis completely ordered.\n71G. R EMARKS . (a): Under the assumptions of Proposition 71F, it is by no\nmeans the case in general that supEA= supDA.\n(b): In every ordered set, the collection of order-convex sets is intersection-stable.\n(c): Let the set Dbe given, and consider the set of all relations in D, completely\nordered by the relation “narrower than”, and the corresponding collection P(D×\nD), ordered by inclusion, of their graphs (cf. Remark 71A,(d)). For each of the\nfollowing properties of relations in D, the collection of graphs of all relations having\nthis property is intersection-stable: reﬂexive, symmetric, trans itive. (But neither\nantisymmetric nor total, unless Dis empty or a singleton, since D×Dis not the\ngraph of an antisymmetric relation, and the intersection of the gra phs of all total ones\nis empty.) Consequently, the set of all reﬂexive relations in Dis inﬁmum-stable, as\nare the sets of all symmetric and of all transitive relations in D. By Proposition 71E,\nthe set of all relations in Dhaving any given combination of these properties is also\ninﬁmum-stable. In particular, the set of all equivalence relations in Dis inﬁmum-\nstable.\nWe recall that every order-interval in an ordered set Dis an order-convex subset\nofD. We now examine the converse implication when Dis totally ordered.\n71H. P ROPOSITION .Let the totally ordered set Dbe given. Then Dis completely\nordered if and only if\n(71.1) every order-convex subset of Dis an order-interval .\nProof. Proof of the “only if” part. Assume that Dis completely ordered.

Assume that Dsatisﬁes (71.1). There are no order-intervals\nin an empty ordered set, but Ditself is an order-convex subset of D. By (71.1), Dis\nnot empty and is an order-interval. Therefore Dhas a minimum and a maximum.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 118\n108 CHAPTER 7. COMPLETELY ORDERED SETS\nLet the subset AofDbe given. Then Ub( A) is order-convex and contains max D.\nBy (71.1), Ub( A) is a non-empty order-interval. By Proposition 61G ↓, Ub(A) has an\ninﬁmum, and by Proposition 61C,(d) this inﬁmum is the supremum of A.\nWe have shown that every subset of Dhas a supremum. By Proposition 71B ↑it\nfollows that Dis completely ordered.\n71I. R EMARK . The ordered sets described by the graphic representations sho wn\nbelow (cf.

We may then choose x,y∈Dsuch\nthatxandyare not ≺-comparable.

Pre-completely ordered sets\nSome very important ordered sets are not completely ordered, bu t have nearly\nthe same properties. An example is Rordered by ≤, which has neither a maximum\nnor a minimum; all its closed order-intervals, however, considered a s ordered subsets,\nare completely ordered. We therefore introduce a new concept. A setDordered by\n≺is said to be pre-completely ordered (by≺) if every non-empty subset of D\nthat has an upper bound has a supremum and every non-empty sub set ofDthat\nhas a lower bound has an inﬁmum. (Instead of the term pre-completely ordered one\nencounters conditionally completely ordered orrelatively completely ordered. Some\nmathematicians prefer to use the term completely ordered for this concept, and make\nappropriate modiﬁcations when referring to completely ordered se ts as deﬁned in\nthese notes.)\n72A. R EMARKS . (a): The empty set is pre-completely ordered by its only relation.\n(b): Every completely ordered set is pre-completely ordered (see also Proposition\n72E,(a)).\n(c): If the set Dis pre-completely ordered by ≺, then it is also pre-completely\nordered by the reverse order /follows. The convention introduced in Remark 61F is therefore\nin force for propositions concerning pre-completely ordered sets .\nIn the deﬁnition of a pre-completely ordered set, either half of the deﬁning condi-\ntion is redundant, as we now show.\n72B↑. PROPOSITION .An ordered set Dis pre-completely ordered if (and only if)\nevery non-empty subset of Dthat has an upper bound has a supremum.\nProof . Assume that every non-empty subset of Dthat has an upper bound has a\nsupremum. Let the non-empty subset AofDbe given and assume that Ahas a lower\nbound. Then Lb( A) is a non-empty subset of Dthat has an upper bound (any member\nchosen in the non-empty subset A), and therefore a supremum, say s:= sup Lb(A).\nIt now follows by Proposition 61C,(d) that Ahas an inﬁmum (namely s).\nIfDis a pre-completely ordered set, then every non-empty order-bo unded subset\nofDhas both a supremum and an inﬁmum. One might be tempted to conjec ture\nthat the converse is true; but we now produce a counterexample. We shall show later\nthat the conjecture is right when Dis totally ordered (Proposition 72J).\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 120\n110 CHAPTER 7.

Proof of (a). Assume that Dhas a maximum and a minimum. Let the\nsubsetAofDbe given. If A/negationslash= Ø, then max D∈Ub(A), and therefore Ahas a\nsupremum.

By the assumption, Ahas a supremum (with respect to D) and\ny≺supDA≺z; sincey,z∈E, we have supDA∈E. by Proposition 61B,(b) it\nfollows that Ahas a supremum in E(and in fact supEA= supDA).\nSinceAwas an arbitrary non-empty subset of E, it follows from Proposition 72B ↑\nthat the ordered subset Eis pre-completely ordered.

Then (D;≺)is pre-completely\nordered if and only if there exists a completely ordered set (D/prime;≺/prime)such that (D;≺)\nis order-isomorphic to the ordered subset ] ]minD/prime,maxD/prime[ [of(D/prime;≺/prime).\nProof. Proof of the “if” part . A completely ordered set ( D/prime;≺/prime) is pre-completely\nordered (Remark 72A,(b)), and the ordered subset ] ]min D/prime,maxD/prime[ [ is also pre-\ncompletely ordered (Proposition 72E,(b)). If ( D;≺) is order-isomorphic to this or-\ndered subset, it is itself pre-completely ordered.\nProof of the “only if” part . Assume that ( D;≺) is pre-completely ordered. Choose\ndistinct objects αandω, neither of which is a member of D, and setD/prime:=D∪{α,ω}.\nDeﬁne the relation ≺/primeinD/primeby the rule\n∀x,y∈D/prime, x≺/primey:⇔(x=αory=ωor (x,y∈Dandx≺y)).\nIt is easy to verify that ≺/primeis an order in D/prime. In the ordered set ( D/prime;≺/prime) we have\nα= minD/prime, ω= maxD/prime,andD= ] ]a,ω[ [ = ] ]minD/prime,maxD/prime[ [. It is also clear that\n1Dis an order-isomorphism from ( D;≺) to the ordered subset ] ]min D/prime,maxD/prime[ [ of\n(D/prime;≺/prime). It remains to prove that ( D/prime;≺/prime) is completely ordered.\nLet the subset AofD/primebe given. If ω∈A, then supD/primeA= maxA=ω. If\nA⊂ {α}, then supD/primeA=α. Suppose now that Adoes not contain ωand is not a\nsubset of {α}. ThenA∩D/negationslash= Ø. IfA∩Dhas no upper bound in ( D;≺), then\nω∈UbD/prime(A)⊂UbD/prime(A∩D) ={ω}; hence Ub D/prime(A) ={ω}, and supD/primeA=ω.\nIf, on the other hand, A∩Ddoes have an upper bound in ( D;≺), which is the\nordered subset ] ] α,ω[ [ of (D/prime;≺/prime), it has a supremum there. Since ω /∈A, we have\nUbD/prime(A) = Ub D/prime(A∩D) = [ [supD(A∩D),ω] ]. Hence supD(A∩D) is the minimum\nof Ub D/prime(A), so that supD(A∩D) = supD/primeA. We have shown that every subset Aof\nD/primehas a supremum in ( D/prime;≺/prime). By Proposition 71B ↑, we conclude that ( D/prime;≺/prime) is\ncompletely ordered.\n72H↑. REMARK .

If Dhas a maximum,\nthe assertion of Theorem 72G remains valid if ] ]min D/prime,maxD/prime[ [ is replaced by ] ]min D/prime,\nmaxD/prime] ] (just setD/prime:=D∪{α}in the proof).

(i)⇒(ii). This implication is trivial.\n(ii)⇒(iii). Assume that (ii) holds. Let a,b∈Dwitha≺bbe given, and let\nthe subsetAof [ [a,b] ] be given. If A= Ø, then sup[ [a,b] ]A=a. We now assume that\nA/negationslash= Ø. Since Ahas the upper bound band the lower bound a,Ahas a supremum\nsupDA, and supDA≺b. Since Ø /negationslash=A⊂[ [a,b] ], we also have a≺supDA. Thus\nsupDA∈[ [a,b] ]. By Proposition 61B,(b), we ﬁnd that Ahas a supremum with respect\nto [ [a,b] ]. By Proposition 71B ↑, the ordered subset [ [ a,b] ] is completely ordered.\n(iii)⇒(i). Assume that (iii) holds. Let the non-empty subset AofDbe given,\nand assume that Ahas an upper bound, say b. Choosea∈A. Then the ordered\nsubset [ [a,b] ] is completely ordered. Therefore A∩[ [a,b] ] has a supremum with respect\nto [ [a,b] ], says:= sup[ [a,b] ](A∩[ [a,b] ]). We claim that sis the supremum of Awith\nrespect to D. SinceAwas an arbitrary non-empty subset of Dhaving an upper\nbound, it will then follow from Proposition 72B ↑thatDis pre-completely ordered,\nas asserted.\nTo establish our claim concerning s, we use the assumption that Dis totally\nordered. Let x∈Abe given; then x≺b, anda≺xorx≺a. Ifa≺x≺b, then\nx∈A∩[ [a,b] ], so thatx≺s; if, on the other hand x≺a, thenx≺a≺s. In either\ncase we have found x≺s.

Ifb≺y, then\ns≺b≺y; if, on the other hand, a≺y≺b, theny∈[ [a,b] ]∩UbD(A) = Ub [ [a,b] ](A),\nso thats≺y. In either case we have found s≺y. Sincey∈UbD(A) was arbitrary,\nwe conclude that s= min Ub D(A) = supDA, and our claim is established.\n(i)⇒(iv). Assume that Dis pre-completely ordered. By Theorem 72G we may\nassume that Dis the ordered subset ] ]min D/prime,maxD/prime[ [ of a completely ordered set\nD/prime; sinceDis totally ordered, so is D/prime. By Proposition 71H, every order-convex\nsubset ofDis an order-interval of D/primethat is included in D.

We claim that every\norder-convex subset of the totally ordered closed order-interv al [ [a,b] ] is an order-\ninterval of [ [ a,b] ]; it will follow by Proposition 71H that [ [ a,b] ] is completely ordered.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 123\n72.

COMPLETELY ORDERED SETS\n73. Closure mappings\nThroughout this section we consider a set Dcompletely ordered by ≺.\nAn isotone mapping ω∈Isot(D,D ) is called a closure mapping (inD) if it\nsatisﬁes the following conditions:\n(Aug) : x≺ω(x) for all x∈D,\n(Idp) : ω◦ω=ω.\nA mapping ω:D→Dthat satisﬁes (Aug) may be said to be augmenting . (The\nterm most frequently used for this is increasing , but that use may produce a clash in\ncertain contexts in which the same term has traditionally been used t o mean “[strictly]\nisotone”.) This condition may be rephrased as 1 D≺ωin the valuewise order of\nMap(D,D ). We recall that a mapping satisfying (Idp) is said to be idempotent .\n73A. P ROPOSITION .Let the set Dcompletely ordered by ≺be given. A mapping\nω:D→Dis a closure mapping if and only if it satisﬁes (Aug) and\n(73.1) x≺ω(y)⇒ω(x)≺ω(y)for allx,y∈D.\n73B.

Then the mapping ρ>is\nalways isotone from P(S) completely ordered by inclusion to itself, but it is a closure\nmapping in P(S) if and only if ρis reﬂexive and transitive. The same assertion holds\nfor the mapping ρ<.\nThe fundamental result about closure mappings is a characterizat ion of their\nranges and the sets of their ﬁxed points.\n73D. T HEOREM .Let a completely ordered set Dbe given.\n(a): Ifω:D→Dis a closure mapping, then Rngωis inﬁmum-stable and\n(73.2) Rng ω= Fixω.\n(b): IfEis an inﬁmum-stable subset of D, then the mapping clos E:D→D\ndeﬁned by the rule\nclos E(x) := inf(E∩Ub({x}))for all x ∈D\nis a closure mapping.\n(c):Ifω:D→Dis a closure mapping and Eis an inﬁmum-stable subset of D,\nthen Rngω=Eif and only if clos E=ω.\nProof. Proof of (a). Sinceωis idempotent, (73.2) holds, by Proposition 26C.\nLet a subset Aof Rngωbe given. By (73.2), ω>(A) =A. Since infA∈Lb(A) and\nωis isotone, we have ω(infA)∈Lb(ω>(A)) = Lb(A), whenceω(infA)≺infA. Since\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 125\n73. Closure mappings 115\nωis augmenting, we have inf A≺ω(infA); consequently, inf A=ω(infA)∈Rngω.\nSinceAwas an arbitrary subset of Rng ω, we conclude that Rng ωis inﬁmum-stable.\nProof of (b). For each x∈D, we havex= inf Ub( {x})≺inf(E∩Ub({x})) =\nclos E(x), so thatω:= clos Esatisﬁes (Aug).\nLetx,y∈Dbe given. If x≺clos E(y) = inf(E∩Ub({y})), it follows that\nE∩Ub({y})⊂Ub({x}), and hence that E∩Ub({y})⊂E∩Ub({x}); from this\nwe obtain clos E(x)≺clos E(y). Sincex,y∈Dwere arbitrary, we conclude that\nω:= clos Esatisﬁes (73.1). By Proposition 73A, clos Eis a closure mapping.\nProof of (c). Assume ﬁrst that Rng ω=E, and letx∈Dbe given. We have\nω(x)∈E∩Ub({x}), sinceωis augmenting, so that clos E(x)≺ω(x). On the other\nhand, for every y∈E∩Ub({x}) we have ω(y) =y(from (a)) and x≺y, and\nthereforeω(x)≺ω(y) =y. If follows that ω(x)∈Lb(E∩Ub({x})), and therefore\nω(x)≺clos E(x). We have shown that clos E(x) =ω(x) for allx∈D, i.e., that\nclos E=ω.\nAssume, conversely, that clos E=ω, and letx∈Dbe given. If x∈E, then\nω(x) = inf(E∩Ub({x})) =x. On the other hand, if ω(x) =x, thenx= clos E(x) =\ninf(E∩Ub({x}))∈E, sinceEis inﬁmum-stable. Since x∈Dwas arbitrary, we\nconclude that E= Fixω. It now follows from (a) that Rng ω=E.\n73E. R EMARK . Theorem 73D,(c) asserts that each of the mappings ω/mapsto→Rngω\nandE/mapsto→clos Ebetween the set of all closure mappings in Dand the collection of all\ninﬁmum-stable subsets of Dis the inverse of the other.\n73F.

The collection\nIof all intervals inR, i.e., order-convex subsets of R, is intersection-stable (Remark\n71G,(b)). The mapping clos Iassigns to each subset of Rthe smallest interval includ-\ning it. For instance, if Ais a subset of Rthat has a maximum but no minimum, then\nclosI(A) is ]infA,maxA] or ]− ∞,maxA], according as Ahas or fails to have a lower\nbound.\n73G. C OROLLARY .Let the completely ordered set Dand the closure mappings ω\nandω/primeinDbe given. Then ω/prime◦ωis a closure mapping if and only if ω/prime\n>(Rngω)⊂\nRngω. This is the case, in particular, if ωandω/primecommute.\nProof . Assume ﬁrst that ω/prime◦ωis a closure mapping. For every x∈ω/prime\n>(Rngω) =\nRng(ω/prime◦ω) we have, by Theorem 73D,(a), x≺ω(x)≺ω/prime(ω(x)) =x, so that\nx=ω(x)∈Rngω. This proves that ω/prime\n>(Rngω)⊂Rngω.\nAssume, conversely, that ω/prime\n>(Rngω)⊂Rngω. Nowω/prime◦ωis obviously isotone and\naugmenting. For every x∈Dwe haveω/prime(ω(x))∈Rngω, and Theorem 73D,(a) implies\nω(ω/prime(ω(x))) =ω/prime(ω(x)). Therefore ω/prime(ω(ω/prime(ω(x)))) =ω/prime(ω/prime(ω(x))) =ω/prime(ω(x)). We\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 126\n116 CHAPTER 7. COMPLETELY ORDERED SETS\nhave shown that ω/prime◦ωis also idempotent; hence it is a closure mapping.\nLet a setSbe given. It was pointed out in Remark 71G,(c) that the set of all\ntransitive relations in Sis an inﬁmum-stable subset of the set of all relations in S,\ncompletely ordered by the order “narrower than”. By Theorem 73 D,(b), there is a\nclosure mapping associated with this inﬁmum-stable subset. If ρis a relation in S,\nthe value of this closure mapping at ρis called the transitive closure of ρ; it is the\nnarrowest of all transitive relations that are broader than ρ.\n73H. P ROPOSITION .Letρbe a relation in the set S, and letτbe the transitive\nclosure ofρ. Then\n(73.3) ∀x,y∈S, xτ y ⇔(x ρ y or (∃z∈S, x τ z and z ρ y ))\n(73.4) ∀x,y∈S, x τ y ⇔(x ρ y or (∃z∈S, x ρ z and z τ y )).\nProof . Deﬁne the relation σinSby the rule\n∀x,y∈S, x σ y :⇔(x ρ y or (∃z∈S, x τ z andz ρ y )).\nSinceρis narrower than τ, andτis transitive, we have for all x,y∈Sthe chain of\nimplications\nx σ y ⇒(x τ y or (∃z∈S, x τ z andz τ y ))⇒x τ y,\nso thatσis narrower than τ.\nFor allx,y,z ∈Swe have the chain of implications\n(xσ y andy σ z )⇒\n\nx τ y andy ρ z, or\nx τ y and (∃w∈S, y τ w andw ρ z )\n\n⇒\n⇒\n\nx τ y andy ρ z, or\n∃w∈S, x τ w andw ρ z\n\n⇒x σ z.\nThereforeσis transitive. Since σis obviously broader than ρ, it follows that σis also\nbroader than the transitive closure τofρ. Henceσ=τ, and (73.3) is proved.\nThe proof of (73.4) is completely similar. It may also be obtained by app lying\n(73.3) to the reverse relation ρ←instead of to ρ; indeed, relation-reversal is an involu-\ntory order-isomorphism of the set of all relations on D, ordered by “narrower than”,\nto itself, and it preserves transitivity (cf. Proposition 55C).\nWe conclude this section with a technical result describing the relatio nship be-\ntween suprema and inﬁma with respect to Dand with respect to some inﬁmum-\nstable subset E. We recall that, according to Proposition 71F, the ordered subse tE\nis completely ordered.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 127\n73.

Since clos Eis augmenting, Proposition 61B,(a) yields supDA≺\nsupD(clos E)>(A)≺supE(clos E)>(A). By Theorem 73D, E={x∈D|clos E(x) =x};\nsince clos Eis isotone, we ﬁnd\nclos E(supDA)≺clos E(supE(clos E)>(A)) = supE(clos E)>(A).\nOn the other hand, for each x∈Awe havex≺supDA, whence clos E(x)≺\nclos E(supDA)∈E; therefore clos E(supDA)∈UbE((clos E)>(A)), whence\nsupE(clos E)>(A)≺clos E(supDA). We conclude that equality must hold.\nFor eachx∈Awe have inf DA≺x, whence clos E(inf DA)≺clos E(x); since\nRng closE=E, we then have clos E(inf DA)∈LbE((clos E)>(A)), whence\nclos E(inf DA)≺infE(clos E)>(A).\nProof of (b). Since A⊂Ewe have (clos E)>(A) =A. Part (a) then yields\nclos E(supDA) = supEA.

E XAMPLE . For every mapping f:S→T, the pair ( f>,f<) is a Galois\ncorrespondence from P(S) ordered by inclusion to P(T) ordered by the reverse of\ninclusion, on account of Proposition 23A.\nThe next proposition gives a complete account of all Galois correspo ndences from\nP(S) toP(T), both ordered by inclusion, for given sets SandT. Here we require\nthe concept of a relation from StoT(Section 54).\n74C.

Let (Φ,Ψ) be a Galois correspondence satisfying (74.2).

In particular, Ψ( {y}) =ρ<({y}) for every y∈T. Using this\ninstead of (74.2), we verify (74.3) in the same manner.\nConversely, the pair of mappings (Φ ,Ψ) deﬁned by (74.3) and (74.4) obviously\nsatisﬁes (74.2), and it is a matter of direct veriﬁcation that it is a Galo is correspon-\ndence.\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 129\n74.

By Theorem 73D,\n(φ/prime◦φ)(x) = inf(Rng ω∩Ub({x})) = clos Rngω(x) =ω(x) for all x∈D.\nThusφ/prime◦φ=ωand, in particular, φ/prime◦φis augmenting. On the other hand,\nA⊂Ub({infA}) for allA∈P(D). Therefore\nA⊂Rngω∩Ub({infA}) = (φ◦φ/prime)(A) for all A∈P(Rngω),\nso thatφ◦φ/primeis also augmenting.

Proof by induction\nIn this chapter we shall explain precisely what is meant by the terms proof by in-\nduction andrecursive deﬁnition , two procedures that are fundamental in all branches\nof mathematics. The structure underlying each instance of these procedures is a\nwell-founded set.\nWe recall from Section 64 that an ordered set is said to be well-founded if every\nnon-empty subset has at least one minimal member. As a special cas e of this, an\nordered set is said to be well-ordered if every non-empty subset has a minimum.\nAn ordered set is well-ordered if and only if it is both totally ordered an d well-founded\n(Proposition 64A).\nLet the set Iordered by ≺be given. In this section and the next, an important\npart will be played by the set of all members of Ithat strictly precede a given member\niofI; this is also the set of strict lower bounds of {i}. We denote this set by Spr( i),\nso that\nSpr(i) :={j∈I|j/precedenotslnteqli}=/precedenotslnteql<({i}) = Lb( {i})\\{i}for alli∈I.\nThe availability of proofs by induction rests on the following result.\n81A.

The equivalence of (i) and (ii) follows at once.\n123\nApril 17, 2014 11:57 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 134\n124 CHAPTER 8. INDUCTION AND RECURSION\n81B.

By (82.9) we deduce that m∈K, a contradiction.\nTherefore we must have K=Landa=a/prime|L.\nConversely, it follows at once from (82.13) that K:=Landa:=a/prime|Lsatisfy (82.9)\nand (82.10). This completes the proof of the existence and uniquen ess ofKanda\nsatisfying (82.9) and (82.10).\n3. LetJbe a subset of Isuch that Spr( i)⊂Jfor alli∈J, and letb∈×\ni∈JAi\nbe given.

Conversely, if J⊂Kit follows at once from (82.10)\nthatb:=a|Jsatisﬁes (82.11).\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 140\n130 CHAPTER 8. INDUCTION AND RECURSION\nProof of (b). This is an immediate consequence of (82.9) and the following lemma .\n82F. L EMMA .Let the well-ordered set Iand the subset KofIbe given. The\nfollowing statements are equivalent:\n(i): Spr(i)⊂Kfor everyi∈K.\n(ii):K=I,or elseK= Spr(min( I\\K)).\n(iii):K=I or K = Spr(k)for somek∈I.\n(iv): ifK/negationslash=I,there is exactly one k∈Isuch thatK= Spr(k).\nProof . The implications (ii) ⇒(iii) and (iv) ⇒(i) are trivial, and so is (iii) ⇒(iv)\nsinceIis totally ordered (Proposition 64A). It remains to prove the implicat ion (i)\n⇒(ii). Suppose that (i) holds and that K/negationslash=I, and setk:= min(I\\K). Obviously,\nSpr(k)⊂K. We have to prove the reverse inclusion. Let i∈Kbe given. From (i)\nwe have Spr( i)⊂K. Sincek /∈Kwe infer that k/negationslash=iandk /∈Spr(i), i.e.,kdoes\nnot precede i. SinceIis totally ordered, we conclude that istrictly precedes k, i.e.,\ni∈Spr(k). Sincei∈Kwas arbitrary, we have proved the desired reverse inclusion\nK⊂Spr(k), and therefore K= Spr(k), as asserted by (ii).\n82G. E XAMPLE∗. Without going into details, we mention that Theorem 82E\napplies to all recursive algorithms with “stopping rules”, such as the Euclidean algo-\nrithm for ﬁnding the greatest common divisor of two natural numbe rs, or a computer\nprogram for approximating a solution of a polynomial equation by New ton’s method.\nAnother situation in which Theorem 82B is not suﬃcient as it stands is t his: the\nrecursive rule, instead of specifying aiitself when the ajforj∈Spr(i) are known,\nmerely speciﬁes a set from which aiis to be chosen . The problem is further compli-\ncated by the possibility that this set is not guaranteed to be non-em pty, unless the\najforj∈Spr(i) already satisfy the recursion rule themselves.\n•82H. T HEOREM .Let the well-founded set Iand the family of sets (Ai|i∈I)\nbe given. Let a family of set-valued mappings (Φi|i∈I)also be given with Φi∈\nMap(×\nj∈Spr(i)Aj,P(Ai))for alli∈I. Assume that\n(82.14)(∀j∈Spr(i), u j∈Φj(u|Spr(j)))⇒Φi(u)/negationslash= Ø\nfor alli∈I and u ∈×\nj∈Spr(i)Aj.\nThen there exists a family a∈×\ni∈IAisuch that\n(82.15) ai∈Φi(a|Spr(i))for alli∈I.\nProof . 1.•For eachi∈Iand each non-empty subset BofAiwe chooseγi(B)∈B.\n(This is equivalent to •choosing a member of ×\n(i,B)∈ΞB, where Ξ :=˙/uniondisplay\ni∈IP×(Ai).)\nWe deﬁne the family ( Ui|i∈I) by\n(82.16)Ui:={u∈×\nj∈Spr(i)Aj| ∀j∈Spr(i), u j∈Φj(u|Spr(j))} for alli∈I.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 141\n82. Recursive deﬁnitions 131\nWe can rephrase (82.14) as\nΦi(u)/negationslash= Ø for all i∈Iandu∈Ui.\nWe may therefore deﬁne the family of mappings ( φi|i∈I) withφi∈Map(Ui,Ai)\nfor alli∈Iby the rule\n(82.17) φi(u) :=γi(Φi(u))∈Φi(u) for all i∈Iandu∈Ui.\nWe now have the assumptions of Theorem 82E. We therefore obtain a subsetK\nofIand a family a∈×\ni∈KAisatisfying (82.9) and (82.10).\n2. We now show by induction that K=I. Leti∈Ibe given and suppose\nthat Spr(i)⊂K(induction hypothesis). For every j∈Spr(i) we havej∈Kand,\nby (82.10) and (82.17), aj=φj(a|Spr(j))∈Φj(a|Spr(j)). Therefore a|Spr(i)∈Ui, by\n(82.16). It then follows by (82.9) that i∈K. This completes the induction step. We\nhave shown that K=Iand, by (82.10) and (82.17), that asatisﬁes (82.15).\nThe following terminology is used in connection with Theorem 82H. Given the\nwell-founded set Iand the families ( Ai|i∈I) and (Φ i|i∈I) and assuming that\n(82.14) is satisﬁed, a family a∈×\ni∈IAithat satisﬁes (82.15) is said to be chosen\nrecursively by the rule (82.15).\nJuly 25, 2013 17:28 WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in icmp12-master\nThis page intentionally left blankThis page intentionally left blank\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 143\nChapter 9\nTHE NATURAL NUMBERS\n91. Principles of counting\nThe natural or counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc., are so deeply embe dded in our social\nand intellectual culture that it may seem strange to assert that th ey require more than\ncursory analysis. A closer examination of their history and function reveals, however,\nthat the art of counting is the product of a complicated cultural de velopment.\nSome of the ideas about numbers that seem to us obvious are shown by the\nhistoric, anthropological, and linguistic evidence not to have been ob vious at all.\nAmong these often imperfectly realized ideas are: the use of a comm on system of\nnumbers for counting, regardless of the nature of the objects c ounted; the perception\nthat quantitative judgments about collections of objects are red ucible to counting; the\nnotion that numbers can be recorded by symbols that reﬂect the p rocess of counting.\n(For some of the evidence on these matters, as well as much more a bout numbers, an\ninteresting source is K. Menninger, Zahlwort und Ziﬀer , translated as Number Words\nand Number Symbols (M.I.T. Press).)\nThe most diﬃcult idea to grasp in all its implications appears to have bee n the\ninnocent-looking insight that counting goes on and on: there always is a next number.\nPhilosophical discussions about the “potential” or “actual” inﬁniten ess of the set\nof all numbers have lasted well into the twentieth century of our er a. Archimedes\n(Aρχιµ ´ηδης, d. 212 B.C.E.), in his Ψαµµ ´ιτης (The Sand-Reckoner ) struggled to make\nplain a related matter. To simplify his point somewhat: he showed that some huge\ncollection — all the grains of sand in the entire world — was neither “inﬁn ite”, as some\nclaimed, nor, as others averred, “not inﬁnite, yet greater than a ny nameable number”,\nbut was, on the contrary, comfortably within the scope of a well-de signed system of\ncounting. The point for us is that valid conclusions can be drawn conc erning natural\nnumbers no matter how great; even so great that they are wholly b eyond eﬀective\nrecording, not to mention attainment through actual counting. T his suggests the\nneed for a ﬁrmer framework than can be constructed by inspectin g the few small\nnumbers that are within our immediate experience.\nWe shall base our understanding of the natural numbers on some e lementary\ninsights concerning the process of counting, and on nothing else. T his will therefore\n133\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 144\n134 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\nbe a thoroughly “ordinal” view of the natural numbers, as opposed to a “cardinal”\nview. The contrast is perhaps best illustrated by a sketch of the de ﬁnition of the\noperation of addition of natural numbers. The “ordinal” approach says thatm+n\nis obtained by “counting m” from 0 to m, and then “counting nmore” from mto\nm+n. The “cardinal” approach would consist in realizing m+nby taking a set\n“withmmembers” and another, disjoint from it, “with nmembers”, to obtain their\nunion, a set “with m+nmembers”. There appears to be a consensus to the eﬀect\nthat the “ordinal” approach, one version of which we adopt, is more easily formulated\nand leads to usable results faster. Some of the ﬂavor of the “card inal” approach will\nbe found in Chapter 10.\nThe insights concerning counting that we consider basic are: that c ounting has\na beginning (which, for various good reasons, we take to be 0 rathe r than 1); that\ncounting proceeds by going from each number to the next number; that a number,\nonce counted, is never counted again; and that every number is co unted “eventually”.\nTo formalize these insights, we deﬁne a counting system to be a setNendowed\nwith structure by the prescription of a member 0 of N, called zero , and of a mapping\nseq:N→N, called the successor-mapping , subject to the following conditions:\n(Count I): 0 /∈Rng seq.\n(Count II): seq is injective .\n(Count III): ∀S∈P(N), (0 ∈S and seq>(S)⊂S)⇒S=N.\nWe shall show in Section 95 that counting systems are all alike in every thing\nthat matters. The question regarding the existence of counting systems belongs to\nthe foundational aspects of mathematics, and we shall not discus s it: we take it for\ngranted, or agreed, that counting systems exist. Actually, we sh all adopt, or pretend\nto adopt, the naive view that one speciﬁc counting system is reveale d to us, or singled\nout by us, as the Natural-Number System , to be denoted by N, and its members\nto be known as the natural numbers .\n91A. R EMARK . Since everything we do with this Natural-Number System is based\non (Count I), (Count II), (Count III), and on nothing else, ever y conclusion we reach\nabout it will be valid for every other counting system as well.\nWe thus have a set N, whose members are called ( natural )numbers ; a member\n0 ofN, called the number zero ; and a mapping seq : N→N, called the successor-\nmapping , satisfying the conditions\n(NI): 0/∈Rng seq.\n(NII): seq is injective .\n(NIII):∀S∈P(N),(0∈S and seq>(S)⊂S)⇒S=N.\nThe conditions ( NI), (NII), (NIII) are known as the Peano Axioms . They are so\ncalled in honor of Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932), who in 1889 propose d essentially the\nsame conditions as a foundation for a systematic account of the na tural numbers. (As\nPeano explained elsewhere, however, these conditions were origina lly due to Julius\nWilhelm Richard Dedekind (1831-1916).) Condition ( NIII) is known as the Induction\nAxiom , since it underlies a scheme for “proofs by induction” (see Inductiv e-Proof\nScheme 91C).\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 145\n91. Principles of counting 135\nThe value seq nof the successor-mapping at n∈Nis called the successor of n.\nIt is useful to have names for some natural numbers. We deﬁne th e numbers one,\ntwo, and four to be 1 := seq0 ,2 := seq1, and 4 := seq seq2, respectively.\nWe set N×:=N\\{0}, and obtain our ﬁrst consequence of the Peano Axioms.\n91B. P ROPOSITION .N×= Rng seq.\nProof . SetS:={0} ∪Rng seq ⊂N. Then 0 ∈Sand seq>(S)⊂Rng seq ⊂S.\nBy (NIII) we must have {0} ∪Rng seq = S=N, whence N×⊂Rng seq. But by\n(NI) we have Rng seq ⊂N×, and therefore equality must hold.\n91C. I NDUCTIVE -PROOF SCHEME . The Induction Axiom ( NIII) is most fre-\nquently used as follows. Let P( ) denote a predicate describing a property that a\nnatural number may have. We then have the implication\n(91.1) (P(0) and ( ∀n∈N, P(n)⇒P(seqn)))⇒(∀n∈N, P(n)),\nwhich follows upon applying ( NIII) to the subset S:={n∈N|P(n)}ofN.\nThis provides a scheme for a proof of the assertion that P(n) holds for all n∈N:\noneproves thatP(0) holds andthat\n(91.2) P(n)⇒P(seqn) for all n∈N,\nand then applies (91.1) to reach the desired conclusion. The proof o f (91.2) is called\ntheinduction step , and the statement “ P(n)” that occurs in it is called the induction\nhypothesis . A proof according to this scheme is called a proof by induction .\n(This terminology does not clash with that introduced in Section 81: it will be\nseen in Section 93 that the present scheme is actually a special case of the other, as\nalready suggested in Example 81C.)\n\nApril 17, 2014 11:57 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 146\n136 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\n92. Order\nWe recall that with the mapping seq : N→Nwe can associate the functional\nrelationseq/mapsto−→inN, deﬁned by\n∀m,n∈N, mseq/mapsto−→n:⇔n= seqm.\nIt follows from ( NII) that this relation satisﬁes\n(92.1) ∀m,n∈N, mseq/mapsto−→seqn⇔m=n.\nWe deﬁne the relation <inNto be the transitive closure of the relationseq/mapsto−→\n(Section 73), i.e., the narrowest among the transitive relations in Nthat are broader\nthanseq/mapsto−→. For our present purposes it will be enough to recall that this relat ion<is\ntransitive and satisﬁes\n(92.2)∀m,n∈N, m<n ⇔(mseq/mapsto−→nor (∃p∈N, m<p andpseq/mapsto−→n))\n(Proposition 73H).\nFrom (92.2) it follows that m < n can only hold if n∈Rng seq. By ( NI) we\ntherefore have\n(92.3) ∀m,n∈N, m<n ⇒n/negationslash= 0.\nFrom (92.1) and (92.2) we obtain\n(92.4) ∀m,n∈N, m< seqn⇔(m=norm<n ).\nAll the information we need about <beyond its transitivity is contained in (92.3)\nand (92.4). This will be less surprising after consideration of the follo wing proposition.\n92A. P ROPOSITION .There is exactly one relation ρinNsuch that\n(92.5) ∀m,n∈N, m ρ n ⇒n/negationslash= 0\n(92.6) ∀m,n∈N, m ρ seqn⇔(m=norm ρ n );\nnamely, the relation <.\nProof . Suppose that ρ/primeandρ/prime/primeare relations in Nsuch that (92.5) and (92.6) hold\nwithρ:=ρ/primeand also with ρ:=ρ/prime/prime. We prove by induction that P(n) :⇔(∀m∈\nN, m ρ/primen⇔m ρ/prime/primen) holds for all n∈N.\nNowP(0) holds, since both m ρ/prime0 andm ρ/prime/prime0 are ruled out by (92.5) for every\nm∈N. Letn∈Nbe given and suppose that P(n) holds. Then (92.6) yields the\nfollowing chain of equivalences for every m∈N:\nm ρ/primeseqn⇔(m=norm ρ/primen)⇔(m=norm ρ/prime/primen)⇔m ρ/prime/primeseqn,\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 147\n92. Order 137\nand henceP(seqn) holds. This completes the induction step. Thus P(n) holds for all\nn∈N, and this means ρ/prime=ρ/prime/prime. There is thus at most one relation ρinNsatisfying\n(92.5) and (92.6); but from (92.3) and (92.4) it follows that ρ:=<does satisfy (92.5)\nand (92.6).\nThe next few results establish the essential properties of the rela tion<.\n92B. T HEOREM .The relation <is a strict-order in N.\nProof . Since we know that <is transitive, it remains to prove that it is irreﬂexive.\nWe prove by induction that (not( n < n )) holds for all n∈N. From (92.3) we\nobtain (not(0 <0)). Letn∈Nbe given. By (92.4) we have n < seqn; also, if\nseqn < seqn, then seqn=nor seqn < n ; since<is transitive, this implies n < n .\nBy contraposition, (not( n < n )) implies (not(seq n < seqn)). This completes the\ninduction step, and with it the proof.\nTo the strict-order <there corresponds, as usual, the (lax) order ≤, in accordance\nwith Proposition 56A,(b). (Some prefer the symbol /lessdblequalinstead of ≤; both forms are\ncommon.) From now on, the set Nshall be regarded as ordered by ≤, unless a diﬀerent\norder in Nis explicitly speciﬁed. We note that (92.4) implies that seq nimmediately\nfollowsnfor eachn∈N.\nWe next show that the mapping seq : N→Nis strictly isotone, and a bit more.\n92C. P ROPOSITION .\n∀m,n∈N, m<n ⇔seqm< seqn.\nProof . Deﬁne the relation ρinNby\n∀m,n∈N, m ρ n :⇔seqm< seqn.\nBy (92.4) we obtain\n(92.7) ∀m,n∈N, m ρ n ⇔seqm≤n.\nSincem< seqmand since<is transitive, we ﬁnd that mρn impliesm<n . In view\nof (92.3), this shows that ρsatisﬁes (92.5). From (92.7), (92.4), and ( NII) we obtain\n∀m,n∈N, m ρ seqn⇔seqm≤seqn⇔(m=norm ρ n ),\nso thatρsatisﬁes (92.6). Proposition 92A then shows that ρis<, as asserted.\n92D. T HEOREM .The set Nis well-ordered by ≤, with 0 = min Nand1 = min N×.\nProof . 1. We ﬁrst prove by induction that 0 ≤nfor alln∈N. Obviously 0 ≤0.\nLetn∈Nbe given. If 0 ≤n, then (92.4) implies 0 ≤n<seqn. This completes the\ninductive proof. Therefore 0 = min N. An immediate consequence is\n(92.8) 0 ∈A⇒0 = minA for allA∈P(N).\nUsing Propositions 92C and 91B it further follows that\n1 = seq0 = seq min N= min seq>(N) = min N×.\n2. We now prove by induction that\nP(n) :⇔(∀A∈P(N), n∈A⇒(Ahas a minimum))\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 148\n138 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\nholds for all n∈N. NowP(0) holds on account of (92.8). Let n∈Nbe given,\nand assume that P(n) holds. Let Abe a subset of Nthat contains seq n. Then\nn∈A∪ {n}; by the induction hypothesis we may set m:= min (A∪ {n}). Ifm∈A,\nthenm= minA. Ifm /∈A, thenn /∈Aandm=n. Letp∈Abe given. Then\nn= min (A∪ {n})< p. By Proposition 92C, seq n <seqp, and by (92.4), seq n=p\nor seqn < p . Sincep∈Awas arbitrary, it follows that seq n= minA. ThusAhas\na minimum in either case. Therefore P(seqn) holds. This completes the induction\nstep. We have shown that P(n) holds for all n∈N, which means that\nn∈A⇒(Ahas a minimum) for all A∈P(N) andn∈N.\nThis is a complicated way of saying that every non-empty subset AofNhas a mini-\nmum; in other words, that Nis well-ordered.\nIt follows from Theorem 92D and from Proposition 64A that the orde red set Nis\ntotally ordered and well-founded.\nWe introduce some notation. For each n∈N, we setn⊏:= Spr(n) ={m∈\nN|m < n }. Since 0 = min N, the setn⊏is precisely the order-interval [ [0 ,n[ [ of\nN. We also deﬁne n⊐:= seq>(n⊏). In particular, 0⊏= 0⊐= Ø,1⊏={0},2⊏=\n{0,1},1⊐={1},2⊐={1,2}.\n92E. P ROPOSITION .Letn∈Nbe given. Then:\n(a): (seqn)⊏= [ [0,n] ],so thatn= max(seqn)⊏andn⊏= (seqn)⊏\\{n}.\n(b):n⊐= (seqn)⊏\\{0}=] ]0,n] ].Ifn/negationslash= 0, thenn⊐= [ [1,n] ].\nProof . (a) is an immediate consequence of (92.4). From Propositions 92C a nd\n91B we have\nn⊐= seq>(n⊏) = (seqn)⊏∩Rng seq = (seq n)⊏\\{0}.\nFrom (a) we have (seqn)⊏\\{0}= [ [0,n] ]\\{0}=] ]0,n] ]. Ifn/negationslash= 0, then 1 = min N×∈\n] ]0,n] ]⊂N×, and therefore 1 = min] ]0 ,n] ], whence ] ]0 ,n] ] = [ [1,n] ]. This completes the\nproof of (b).\nThe following notation is convenient and suggestive. For given m,n∈Nwe set\n(92.9) m..n :={k∈N|m≤k≤n}=\n\n[ [m,n] ] ifm≤n\nØ ifm>n.\nThis notation is designed to allow the formula “ k∈m..n” to replace, with the least\nalteration, the often-encountered, but inappropriate, formula “k=m,...,n ” (the\nlatter formula misuses the symbol = and includes the uninterpreted ellipsis). We\nnote thatm..n =n⊐\\m⊏for allm,n∈N, except that 0 ..0 ={0}; in particular,\n1..n=n⊐for alln∈N.\nThe set Nitself has no maximum, since n<seqnfor alln∈N. Many subsets of\nN, however, do have maxima.\n92F. P ROPOSITION .A subset of Nhas a maximum if (and only if) it is not empty\nand has an upper bound .\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 149\n92. Order 139\nProof . We prove by induction that\nP(n) :⇔(∀A∈P(n⊏), A/negationslash= Ø⇒(Ahas a maximum))\nholds for all n∈N. This will be suﬃcient: indeed, if mis an upper bound of A,\nthenA⊂(seqm)⊏. NowP(0) holds vacuously, since 0⊏= Ø. Letn∈Nbe given\nand assume that P(n) holds. IfAis a non-empty subset of (seq n)⊏, then Proposition\n92E,(a) leads to an alternative: either max(seq n)⊏=n∈A, and thenn= maxA, or\nelseA⊂(seqn)⊏\\{n}=n⊏, and thenAhas a maximum by the induction hypothesis;\nin either case Ahas a maximum. Therefore P(seqn) holds, and the induction step is\ncomplete.\nWe conclude this section with three results on sequences in ordered sets. We recall\nthat a sequence is a family whose index set is NorN×.\n92G.

General induction and recursive\ndeﬁnitions\n93A. G ENERAL INDUCTIVE -PROOF SCHEME . Since Nis well-ordered (Theorem\n92D), we have available to us the Inductive-Proof Scheme 81B. We n ote that the\ninduction step now reads\n(93.1) ∀n∈N,(∀m∈n⊏, P (m))⇒P(n)\nIf it is necessary to distinguish a proof using the induction step (93.1 ) from one\nthat usesP(0) and (91.2) according to Inductive-Proof Scheme 91C, we shall refer\nto the former as a proof by general induction , and to the latter as a proof by special\ninduction . We note that the latter is actually a particular case of the former, in\nthe following way. We examine the number 0 and the numbers in N×= Rng seq\nseparately. On the one hand, the assertion P(0) trivially implies the assertion ( ∀m∈\n0⊏,P(m))⇒P(0) (they are in fact equivalent). On the other hand, for each n∈N\nwe haven∈(seqn)⊏and the assertion P(n)⇒P(seqn) therefore implies the\nassertion ( ∀m∈(seqn)⊏, P(m))⇒P(seqn).\nAs regards recursive deﬁnitions on the well-ordered index set N, we sometimes\nhave to rely on the full force Theorems 82B, 82E, and 82H, with I:=N. There is,\nhowever, a more usual and more special pattern of recursive deﬁ nition, derived from\nthe general one and related to it just as proofs by special inductio n are related to\nproofs by general induction.

This completes the inductive proof .\nIn the light of Remark 91A, it is interesting to note that the conclusio n of Corollary /triangledownsld\n94B (omitting the explicit form of a) provides a characterization of counting systems,\nas we proceed to show. This fact was observed by Francis William Lawv ere (b. 1937),\nwho used this property to deﬁne what is here called a counting system.\n94F. T HEOREM .Let the setN, the member 0ofN, and the mapping seq :N→N\nbe given. The following statements are equivalent:\n(i):Nis a counting system with 0as zero and seqas successor-mapping.\n(ii): for every set D, every member zofD, and every mapping f:D→Dthere\nexists exactly one mapping φ:N→Dsuch thatφ(0) =zandφ◦seq =f◦φ.\nProof . (i)⇒(ii). This follows from Corollary 94B (using the language of mappings\nrather than that of families/sequences) and Remark 91A.\n(ii)⇒(i). 1. We ﬁrst apply the assumption to D:=N, z := 0, f:= seq, and\nconclude that if a mapping ψ:N→Nsatisﬁesψ(0) = 0 and ψ◦seq = seq ◦ψ, then\nψ= 1N.\n2. Choose distinct objects aandb(e.g.,a:= Ø andb:={Ø}), and setD:=\n{a,b},z:=a, f :=bD→D. Consider the only φ:N→Dsuch thatφ(0) =z=a\nandφ◦seq =f◦φ=bN→D. Thenφ(0) =a/negationslash=b, butφ>(Rng seq) ⊂ {b}. Therefore\n0/∈Rng seq, and (Count I) holds.\n3.

Essential uniqueness of counting\nsystems\nIn this section we digress brieﬂy from our study of the Natural-Num ber System to\ndispose of an issue suggested in Section 91, and perhaps allay some o f the uneasiness\nthat may be felt about singling out one speciﬁc counting system as theNatural-\nNumber System. We shall show that any two counting systems are in fact naturally\nisomorphic , in that there is exactly one invertible mapping from one to the other such\nthat both this mapping and its inverse preserve the structure con sisting of the zero\nand the successor-mapping.\nIn the following theorem, N/primeandN/prime/primeare counting systems. We distinguish their\nzeros by denoting them by 0/primeand 0/prime/prime, and their successor-mappings by denoting them\nby seq/primeand seq/prime/prime, respectively.\n95A. T HEOREM .Let the counting systems N/primeandN/prime/primebe given. There exists\nexactly one mapping φ/prime:N/prime→N/prime/primesuch thatφ/prime(0/prime) = 0/prime/primeandφ/prime◦seq/prime= seq/prime/prime◦φ/prime.\nThere exists exactly one mapping φ/prime/prime:N/prime/prime→N/primesuch thatφ/prime/prime(0/prime/prime) = 0/primeandφ/prime/prime◦seq/prime/prime=\nseq/prime◦φ/prime/prime. Each of the mappings φ/primeandφ/prime/primeis the inverse of the other.\nProof . In view of Remark 91A, Corollary 94B is valid with N/prime,0/prime,seq/primeinstead\nofN,0,seq, respectively. We apply it with D:=N/prime/prime, z:= 0/prime/prime, f:= seq/prime/prime, and\ndeduce that there is exactly one mapping φ/prime:N/prime→N/prime/primesuch thatφ/prime(0/prime) = 0/prime/primeand\nφ/prime◦seq/prime= seq/prime/prime◦φ/prime.\nN/prime/primeN/primeN/prime\nN/prime/prime. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..... .................. ............... seq/prime\n............................................................................................................................................................. ...................\n...................φ/prime............................................................................................................................................................. ...................\n...................φ/prime\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. ....................................\nseq/prime/prime..................................................................................................................................................................\n......................................................\nInterchanging the counting systems N/primeandN/prime/primein the preceding argument, we\ndeduce that there also is exactly one mapping φ/prime/prime:N/prime/prime→N/primesuch thatφ/prime/prime(0/prime/prime) = 0/prime\nandφ/prime/prime◦seq/prime/prime= seq/prime◦φ/prime/prime.\nRepeating the argument with appropriate choices, we further ded uce that there\nis exactly one mapping ψ/prime:N/prime→N/primesuch thatψ/prime(0/prime) = 0/primeandψ/prime◦seq/prime= seq/prime◦ψ/prime.\nHowever, on the one hand 1 N/prime(0/prime) = 0/primeand 1 N/prime◦seq/prime= seq/prime◦1N/prime, and on the other\nhand (φ/prime/prime◦φ/prime)(0/prime) =φ/prime/prime(0/prime/prime) = 0/primeandφ/prime/prime◦φ/prime◦seq/prime=φ/prime/prime◦seq/prime/prime◦φ/prime= seq/prime◦φ/prime/prime◦φ/prime.\nThereforeφ/prime/prime◦φ/prime=ψ/prime= 1N/prime.\nInterchanging N/primeandN/prime/prime, φ/primeandφ/prime/primein the preceding argument, we conclude that\nφ/prime◦φ/prime/prime= 1N/prime/prime.\n95B. E XAMPLE . For the purpose of this example only, a collection of sets is said\nto be saturated if it contains Ø and also contains, for each of its member sets S, the\nsetS∪{S}. It is clear that the intersection of every nonempty collection of sa turated\ncollections is a saturated collection. Now suppose that there exists some saturated\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 157\n95. Essential uniqueness of counting systems 147\ncollection. It follows easily that there is exactly one saturated collec tionNthat is\nthesmallest , in that it is included in every saturated collection. We claim that N,\nwith Ø as zero, and (S/mapsto→S∪{S}) :N → N as the successor-mapping , is a counting\nsystem. (Count I) is trivially satisﬁed, since S∈S∪{S}for every set S. (Count III)\nis satisﬁed precisely because Nis the smallest saturated collection. To prove that\n(Count II) holds, we observe ﬁrst that {S∈ N |S⊂P(S)}is a saturated collection\nincluded in N, and therefore\n(95.1) S⊂P(S) for all S∈ N.\nNow suppose that S,T∈ N satisfyS∪ {S}=T∪ {T}. It follows that T∈S∪ {S},\ni.e.,T=SorT∈S. From (95.1) it then follows that T⊂S. Interchanging Sand\nTin this argument, we infer that S⊂T, and therefore conclude that S=T. This\nshows that (Count II) holds.\nTheorem 95A now informs us that there is exactly one mapping φ:N→ N such\nthatφ(0) = Ø and φ(seqn) =φ(n)∪ {φ(n)}for alln∈N, and that this mapping is\ninvertible.\nThe counting system Nhas some exotic properties, derived from its construction,\nand not from (Count I), (Count II), (Count III). One of these is (95.1); another is\nthe fact that the strict-order <(the transitive closure of the successor-relation in N)\nsatisﬁes the equivalence\n∀S,T∈ N, S <T ⇔S∈T,\nand therefore S⊏:= [ [Ø,S[ [ =Sfor everyS∈ N.\nDespite these and other peculiarities, the absolute uniqueness of a smallest satu-\nrated collection of sets has proved for many mathematicians an irre sistible temptation\nto declare the counting system Nto be theNatural-Number System itself. This turns\nout to be technically attractive in the specialized branch of mathema tics called ax-\niomatic set theory. (The assumption that there exists some saturated collection of\nsets is, in this theory, a foundational agreement called the Axiom of Inﬁnity.) For our\npurposes, however, this identiﬁcation is an unnecessary and perh aps objectionable\ndeparture from intuition.\nFor another approach to constructing a counting system under a n apparently /triangledownsld\nweaker foundational agreement, see Section 106, and in particula r Theorem 106L. /trianglesolid\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 158\n148 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\n96. Addition and subtraction\nOur next aim is to deﬁne the familiar arithmetical operations in Nand to verify\ntheir elementary properties.\nIn Section 91 we proposed to deﬁne addition by “counting on”. Accordingly, we\ndeﬁne the mapping (( m,n)/mapsto→m+n) :N×N→N, called (the operation of )\naddition (of natural numbers ), by the rule\n(96.1) m+n:= seq◦n(m) for all m,n∈N.\nThe symbol + is read “ plus”, andm+nis called the sum ofmandn(mandn\nare the summands ), and is said to be obtained by addingmandnoraddingn\ntom.\nFrom Corollary 94C we have m= seq◦m(0) for allm∈N, and therefore\n(96.2) m+n= (seq◦n◦seq◦m)(0) for all m,n∈N.\nCombining (96.1) and (96.2) we ﬁnd\n(96.3) (m+n) +p= seq◦p(m+n) = (seq◦p◦seq◦n◦seq◦m)(0) for all m,n,p ∈N.\n96A. P ROPOSITION .Addition satisﬁes the following rules, valid for all\nm,n,p ∈N:\n(96.4) m+ seqn= seq(m+n)\n(96.5) m+n= 0⇔m=n= 0\n(96.6) n+ 0 =n\n(96.7) n+ 1 = seqn\n(96.8) m+n=n+m (commutative law )\n(96.9) ( m+n) +p=m+ (n+p) ( associative law )\n(96.10) m+p=n+p⇒m=n (cancellation law ).\nProof . (96.4), (96.6), (96.7) are immediate consequences of (96.1). (96 .5) follows\nfrom (96.4) and Proposition 91B.\nFrom (94.6) applied to D:=Nandf:=g:= seq, we learn that all iterates of seq\ncommute. From (96.2) we therefore get the commutative law (96.8) ; and from (96.3)\nwe get\n(m+n) +p= (n+p) +m for allm,n,p ∈N.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 159\n96. Addition and subtraction 149\nApplying the commutative law to the right-hand side, we obtain the as sociative law\n(96.9).\nBy (NII), seq is injective. By Proposition 94E, every iterate of seq is inje ctive.\nApplying this and (96.1), we obtain the cancellation law (96.10).\nBecause of the associative law (96.9), we may unambiguously write m+n+p;\nand a similar license is in eﬀect for sums of more summands.\n96B. P ROPOSITION .Let the set Dand the mapping f:D→Dbe given. Then:\n(96.11) f◦(m+n)=f◦n◦f◦mfor allm,n∈N.\nProof . By (96.6), f◦(m+0)=f◦m=f◦0◦f◦m. Iff◦(m+n)=f◦n◦f◦m, then (96.4)\nimpliesf◦(m+seqn)=f◦seq(m+n)=f◦f◦(m+n)=f◦f◦n◦f◦m=f◦seqn◦f◦m. This\ncompletes the inductive proof of (96.11).\nThe relationship between addition and order is based on the following r esult.\n96C. P ROPOSITION .\n∀m,n∈N, m<n ⇔(∃p∈N×, n =m+p).\nProof . We deﬁne the relation ρinNby the rule\n(96.12) ∀m,n∈N, m ρ n :⇔(∃p∈N×, n =m+p).\nFrom (96.12), Proposition 91B, and (96.4) we have\n(96.13)∀m,n∈N, m ρ n ⇔(∃p∈N, n=m+ seqp)⇔\n⇔(∃p∈N, n= seq(m+p)).\nFrom (96.13) and ( NI) it follows that m ρn requiresn/negationslash= 0, so that ρsatisﬁes (92.5).\nFrom (96.13), ( NII), and (96.12) we have the following chain of equivalences for all\nm,n∈N:\nm ρseqn⇔(∃p∈N,seqn= seq(m+p))⇔(∃p∈N, n =m+p)⇔\n⇔(m=nor (∃p∈N×, n =m+p))⇔(m=norm ρ n ).\nThereforeρsatisﬁes (92.6). Proposition 92A then shows that ρis<, as asserted.\nWe now consider the following equation, for given m,n∈N:\n(96.14) ? p∈N, m +p=n.\nProposition 96C and the cancellation law allow us to solve the existence and unique-\nness problems for (96.14).\n96D. T HEOREM .For givenm,n∈N, the equation (96.14) has at most one solu-\ntion. It has exactly one solution if and only if m≤n.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 160\n150 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\nProof . The cancellation law (96.10) shows that (96.14) has at most one solu tion.\nThe number 0 is a solution if and only if m=n. Proposition 96C shows that there\nis a solution in N×if and only if m<n .\nWhenm≤n, the unique solution of (96.14) is denoted by n−m, read “nmi-\nnusm”, and called the diﬀerence of nandm. We have thus deﬁned a mapping\n((n,m)/mapsto→n−m) : Gr( ≥)→N, called (the operation of )subtraction (of natural\nnumbers ), by the rule\nn−m:∈ {p∈N|m+p=n} for all (n,m)∈Gr(≥).\nn−mis said to be obtained by subtracting m(thesubtrahend )fromn(the\nminuend ).\n96E.

Thus m+n−p−q= ((m+n)−p)−q.\n96F. P ROPOSITION .Addition, subtraction, and order satisfy the following rul es\n(monotonicity laws), valid for all m,n,p ∈N:\nm<n ⇔m+p<n +p\nm<n ⇔m−p<n −pifp≤m\nm<n ⇔p−n<p −mifn≤p.\nProof . For every q∈N×we have\nm+q=n⇔m+p+q=n+p\nm+q=n⇔m+q−p=n−p⇔m−p+q=n−pifp≤m\nm+q=n⇔m=n−q⇔p−(n−q) =p−m⇔p−n+q=p−mifn≤p.\nThe assertions then respectively follow by Proposition 96C.\nWe mention some useful notational conventions.

Addition and subtraction 151\nIn the same way, if A×B⊂Gr(≥), we denote the image of A×Bunder the operation\nof subtraction by A−B, so that\nA−B:={m−n|m∈A, n∈B}.\nIf either one of AorBis a singleton of the form {p}, it is customary to omit the\nbraces if confusion is unlikely; for instance, one writes p+Binstead of {p}+B.\nExamples of these notations are N+N=N;N×= 1 + N;n⊐−1 =n⊏for each\nn∈N;N×+N×= 2 +N.\nTo conclude this section, we record an application of Proposition 96B to a char-\nacterization of the transitive closure of a relation.\n96G. P ROPOSITION .Let the set Dand the relation ρinDbe given, and let τbe\nthe transitive closure of ρ. Then\n∀x,y∈D, x τ y ⇔(∃n∈N×, y∈(ρ>)◦n({x})).\nProof . We deﬁne the relation σinDby the rule\n∀x,y∈D, x σ y :⇔(∃n∈N×, y∈(ρ>)◦n({x})).\nFor allx,y∈D, we havex ρ y if and only if y∈ρ>({x}) = (ρ>)◦1({x}),and hence\nσis broader than ρ. Ifx,y,z ∈Dsatisfyxσ y andy σ z , we may choose m,n∈N×\nsuch thaty∈(ρ>)◦m({x}) andz∈(ρ>)◦n({y}). By (96.5) we have m+n∈N×. By\nProposition 96B we have\nz∈(ρ>)◦n({y})⊂(ρ>)◦n((ρ>)◦m({x})) = (ρ>)◦(m+n)({x}),\nso thatxσ z . Thusσis transitive. Since τis the transitive closure of ρ, we conclude\nthatσis broader than τ.\nLetx∈Dbe given. Since ρis narrower than τ, we have ( ρ>)◦seq0({x}) =\nρ>({x})⊂τ>({x}). Ifn∈Nis such that ( ρ>)◦seqn({x})⊂τ>({x}), then\n(ρ>)◦seq seq n({x}) =ρ>((ρ>)◦seqn({x}))⊂ρ>(τ>({x}))⊂τ>(τ>({x}))⊂τ>({x}), since\nτis transitive. We have proved by induction that ( ρ>)◦seqn({x})⊂τ>({x}) for all\nn∈N, so thatσ>({x})⊂τ>({x}). Sincex∈Dwas arbitrary, this implies that σis\nnarrower than τ. Sinceσwas also broader than τ, we conclude that σ=τ.\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 162\n152 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\n97. Multiplication and division\nWe shall deﬁne multiplication by iterated addition. We accordingly deﬁne the\nmapping (( m,n)/mapsto→m·n)) :N×N→N, called (the operation of )multiplication\n(of natural numbers ), by the rule\n(97.1) m·n:= (seq◦m)◦n(0) for all m,n∈N.\nThe symbol ·is read “ times ” or “ by”, andm·nis called the product of mand\nn(thefactors ), and is said to be obtained by multiplying mand (orby)n. The\nmultiplication sign ×is sometimes used instead of ·for special emphasis, but is best\navoided. Most frequently, the symbol ·is omitted altogether, the names of the factors\nbeing merely juxtaposed; but it is retained when juxtaposition would be confusing\n(thus 56 /negationslash= 5·6 = 30). The usual rules about omitting parentheses will be observe d;\nmultiplication has priority over addition and subtraction.\nApplying (94.6) twice and using (96.1) and (97.1), we ﬁnd\n(97.2)(seq◦p)◦n(m) = ((seq◦p)◦n◦seq◦m)(0) = (seq◦m◦(seq◦p)◦n)(0) =\n= seq◦m(pn) =pn+m for allm,n,p ∈N.\n97A. P ROPOSITION .Multiplication and addition satisfy the following rules, v alid\nfor allm,n,p ∈N:\n(97.3) m·seqn=mn+m\n(97.4) n·0 = 0\n(97.5) n·1 =n\n(97.6) mn=nm (commutative law )\n(97.7) p(m+n) =pm+pn (distributive law )\n(97.8) m,n∈N×⇔mn∈N×\n(97.9) mn= 1⇔m=n= 1.\nProof . (97.3), (97.4), (97.5) are trivial consequences of the deﬁnitions . The com-\nmutative law follows from (97.1) and (94.8). To prove the distributive law we apply\nProposition 96B together with (97.1), (96.1), and (97.2):\np(m+n) = (seq◦p)◦(m+n)(0) = ((seq◦p)◦n◦(seq◦p)◦m)(0) = (seq◦p)◦n(pm) =pm+pn.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 163\n97. Multiplication and division 153\nTo prove (97.8), assume that m,n∈N×. Using Propositions 96E and 96C, we\nﬁnd\nmn=m·seq(n−1) =m(n−1) +m=m+m(n−1)≥m> 0,\nso thatmn∈N×.The reverse implication follows from (97.4) and the commutative\nlaw. To prove (97.9), assume that mn= 1. By (97.8) we must have m,n∈N×.\nTherefore\n1 =mn=m(n−1) +m=m+m(n−1)≥m≥1\n1 =mn=nm=n(m−1) +n=n+n(m−1)≥n≥1,\nwhich implies m=n= 1. The reverse implication follows from (97.5) and the\ncommutative law.\n97B. P ROPOSITION .Multiplication, subtraction, and order satisfy the follow ing\nrules, valid for all m,n∈Nandp∈N×:\n(97.10) m<n ⇔pm<pn (isotonicity law )\n(97.11) m=n⇔pm=pn (cancellation law )\n(97.12) p(n−m) =pn−pm if m ≤n (distributive law ).\nProof . Ifm < n , thenn−m∈N×. By the distributive law (97.7), we have\npm+p(n−m) =p(m+ (n−m)) =pn, which proves (97.12) (the case m=nis\ntrivial). By (97.8) we have p(n−m)∈N×, and Proposition 96C shows that pm<pn .\nWe have just shown that the mapping ( k/mapsto→pk) :N→Nis strictly isotone. Since N\nis totally ordered, it follows that the mapping is injective — which prove s (97.11) —\nand that the equivalence (97.10) holds (Remark 62A,(a)).\n97C. P ROPOSITION .Let the set Dand the mapping f:D→Dbe given. Then\nf◦mn= (f◦m)◦nfor allm,n∈N.\nProof .f◦(m·0)=f◦0= 1D= (f◦m)◦0. Iff◦mn= (f◦m)◦n, then (97.3) and Proposi-\ntion 96B yield f◦(m·seqn)=f◦(mn+m)=f◦m◦f◦mn=f◦m◦(f◦m)◦n= (f◦m)◦seqn. This\ncompletes the inductive proof.\n97D. C OROLLARY .Multiplication satisﬁes the following rule (associative l aw)\nvalid for all m,n,p ∈N:\n(mn)p=m(np).\nProof . Using (97.1) and Proposition 97C, we ﬁnd\n(mn)p= (seq◦mn)◦p(0) = ((seq◦m)◦n)◦p(0) = (seq◦m)◦np)(0) =m(np).\nBecause of the associative law, we may unambiguously write mnp, without paren-\ntheses; and a similar license is in eﬀect for products of more factors .\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 164\n154 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\nFor images under the operation of multiplication we use a notation simila r to that\npreviously introduced for addition and subtraction. Thus, if AandBare subsets of\nN, we deﬁne\nAB:={mn|m∈A, n∈B}.\nIt is also customary to write pBandApinstead of {p}BandA{p}, and we shall\nusually do so. For instance, the range of the familiar arithmetic prog ression with\ninitial term mand diﬀerence pism+pN.\nFor eachp∈Nwe deﬁne the mapping p·:N→N, called multiplication by p,\nby the rule\np·(n) :=pn for alln∈N.\nOn account of (97.4), (97.5), and the commutative and associative laws, these map-\npings satisfy the rules\n(97.13) 0 ·= 0N→N 1·= 1N\n(97.14) ( p·)◦(q·) =pq· for allp,q∈N,\nand by (97.10) p·is strictly isotone for every p∈N×. We also have Rng( p·) =pNfor\nallp∈N.\nWe can use these mappings to deﬁne exponentiation by iterated multiplication.\nAccordingly, we deﬁne the mapping (( m,n)/mapsto→mn) :N×N→N, called (the opera-\ntion of )exponentiation (of natural numbers ), by the rule\nmn:= (m·)◦n(1) for all m,n∈N.\nThe symbol mnis read “mto the (power )n” or “mto thenth(power )”, andmn\nis said to be obtained by raisingm(thebase )to the power n(theexponent ).\n97E. P ROPOSITION .Exponentiation, multiplication, and addition satisfy the fol-\nlowing rules, valid for all m,n,p ∈N:\nm0= 1m1=m m2=mm 1n= 1\n0n= 0 ifn∈N×\n(mn)p=mpnp\npm+n=pmpnpmn= (pm)n\nn<mnifm> 1.\nIt is useful to note that\n(97.15) 4 = 2 + 2 = 2 ·2 = 22.\nWe now turn to the concept of division . For a given pair ( m,n)∈N×N, we\nconsider the problem\n(97.16) ? q∈N, qn ≤mandm−qn<n.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 165\n97. Multiplication and division 155\n97F. T HEOREM . (97.16) has no solution for any pair (m,n)withn= 0. For\neach pair (m,n)∈N×N×, there is exactly one solution of (97.16), namely max{p∈\nN|pn≤m}.\nProof . The statement concerning the case n= 0 holds trivially. Assume now\nthatn∈N×. The set {p∈N|pn≤m}contains 0, and mis an upper bound:\nindeed, 1 ≤nand therefore pn≤mimpliespn≤m·1≤mn, whencep≤m\n(Proposition 97B). By Proposition 92F this set has a maximum. Deﬁne q0:= max {p∈\nN|pn≤m}.\nWe now use the rules in Propositions 96F and 97B. If qis a solution of (97.16), we\nmust haveqn≤m, and therefore q≤q0. On the other hand, we have m−qn < n ,\nand therefore q0n≤m<qn +n= (seqq)n. This implies q0<seqq, and this in turn\nis equivalent to q0≤q. We conclude that qmust beq0, so that there is at most one\nsolution of (97.16).\nHowever,q0n≤m< (q0+1)n, and therefore m−q0n<(q0+1)n−q0n= 1·n=n,\nso thatq0is indeed a solution of (97.16).\nFor every pair ( m,n)∈N×N×, the unique solution q:= max {p∈N|pn≤m}\nof (97.16) and the corresponding number m−qnare called the quotient and the\nremainder (orresidue ), respectively, of the division of m(thedividend )byn\n(thedivisor ). When the remainder is 0, it is customary to denote the quotient by\nm/n orm\nn. (Theorem 97F rules out “division by 0”.)\nLet the number m∈Nbe given. Since 2⊏={0,1}, the remainder of the division\nofmby 2 is either 0 or 1. If the remainder is 0, mis said to be even ; if the remainder\nis 1,mis said to be odd. Thusmis even if and only if m∈2N, andmis odd if and\nonly ifm∈N\\(2N) = 2N+ 1.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 166\n156 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\n98. Divisors and multiples\nWe record some additional terminology relating to multiplication. Let t he natural\nnumbersm,n be given. If n=mpfor somep∈N, we say that mdividesn, and\nthatnisdivisible by m; andmis called a divisor of n, andnamultiple of m.\n(The clash between this use of the term divisor and the use associated with division\n(Theorem 97F) is unlikely to lead to confusion.) Thus mdividesnif and only if\nn∈mN. The relation “divides” and its reverse, “is a multiple of”, were alread y\nmentioned in several examples in Sections 55, 56, 61, 62, and 64, an ticipating some\nof the results to be proved here and adding some comments.\n98A. P ROPOSITION .The relation “divides” is an order in N.1divides every\nnatural number, and every natural number divides 0.\nProof . The reﬂexivity and the properties of 0 and 1 follow from (97.4), (97 .5),\nand the commutative law (97.6). The transitivity follows from the ass ociative law. It\nremains to prove the antisymmetry. If mdividesnandndividesm, we may choose\np,q∈Nsuch thatmp=nandnq=m. Thennqp=mp=n=n·1. Ifn= 0, then\nm= 0·q= 0, so that m=n. Ifn∈N×, the cancellation law yields qp= 1, and\n(97.9) requires q=p= 1. Therefore m=n·1 =nin this case also.\nTo distinguish the set Nordered by “divides” from the set Nordered by ≤, special\nterminology is used whenever possible. Instead of upper bound, lower bound, supre-\nmum, inﬁmum , the speciﬁc terms common multiple ,common divisor ,least\ncommon multiple ,greatest common divisor are used, and the symbols sup and\ninf are replaced by lcm and gcd, respectively. According to Proposit ion 98A, the\nnumbers 1 and 0 are, respectively, the minimum and the maximum of Nordered by\n“divides”.\n98B. L EMMA .The mapping 1N×is a strictly isotone mapping from N×ordered\nby “divides” to N×ordered by ≤.\nProof . Ifm,n∈N×andp∈Nsatisﬁesn=mp, we must have p∈N×, by (97.8),\nand therefore 1 ≤p. By the isotonicity law, m=m·1≤mp=n. Therefore 1 N×is\nisotone; since it is injective, it is strictly isotone.\n98C. L EMMA .The collection {pN|p∈N} ⊂P(N)is intersection-stable .\nProof . Let the subset AofNbe given, and set S:=/intersectiondisplay\np∈ANpN. By Proposition 98A,\nwe have 0 ∈S. IfS={0}, thenS= 0·N. We may therefore assume that S∩N×/negationslash= Ø\n(which implies 0 /∈A), and setd:= min(S∩N×). We claim that S=dN.\nFor everyp∈A, we haved∈pNand therefore, by the associative law, also\ndN⊂pN. Therefore dN⊂S.\nTo prove the reverse inclusion, let n∈Sbe given, and let qbe the quotient of the\ndivision of nbyd. Letp∈Abe given. Since n,d∈pN, it follows from Proposition\n97B thatn−qd∈pN. Sincep∈Awas arbitrary, we have shown that n−qd∈S.\nBut the deﬁnition of qimplies that n−qd<d . This is compatible with the deﬁnition\nofdonly ifn−qd= 0. But then n∈dN. Sincen∈Swas arbitrary, we have proved\nthatS⊂dN, and our claim that S=dNis established.\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 167\n98. Divisors and multiples 157\n98D. T HEOREM .The set Nordered by the relation “divides” is completely ordered\nand well-founded.\nProof . 1. The set N×is well-ordered, hence well-founded by ≤. It follows from\nLemma 98B and from Proposition 64B that N×ordered by “divides” is well-founded.\nIt follows immediately that N=N×∪ {0}ordered by “divides” is also well-founded.\n(Actually, 0 is a minimal member of {0}, and of no other subset of N.)\n2. For every subset AofN, the set of common multiples of Ais/intersectiondisplay\nn∈ANnN. By\nLemma 98C, this set is dNfor a suitable d∈N. Butdis a member of, and divides\nevery member of, dN; thereforedis the least common multiple of A. By Proposition\n71B↑, it follows that Nis completely ordered by the order “divides”.\n98E. T HEEUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM . The purpose of the procedure described\nhere is to ﬁnd, for given m,p∈N×, the greatest common divisor of {m,p}. The\nsuccess of the procedure rests on the following observation: If(m,p)∈N×N×, and\nifris the remainder of the division of mbyp, then gcd{m,p}= gcd{p,r}.Ifqis\nthe quotient of the same division, we have r=m−qpandm=r+qp. It follows\nfrom these, together with the associative and distributive laws, th at every common\ndivisor ofmandpalso divides r, and every common divisor of pandralso divides\nm. This establishes the claimed observation.\nLet us use the notation rem( u,v) for the remainder of the division of ubyv(so\nthat we have a mapping rem : N×N×→N). Informally, the algorithm proceeds by\nattempting to construct recursively a sequence ( pn|n∈N) in which p0:=p,p1:=\nrem(m,p), andpn+1:= rem(pn−1,pn) forn >1. This construction breaks oﬀ when,\nfor somek∈N×, we havepk+1= 0. When it does, we have pk= gcd{m,p}.\nMore formally, this is an instance of a recursive deﬁnition with a rule th at “breaks\ndown”. We formulate it as an application of Theorem 93C, and there is no formal\nreason to exclude the possibility that morpmight be 0.\nWe specify the data in the assumption of Theorem 93C as follows: An:=N×N\nandBn:=N×N×for alln∈N;z:= (m,p)∈N×N, andhn((u,v)) := (v,rem(u,v))\nfor alln∈Nand (u,v)∈N×N×. According to Theorem 93C there are now two\nalternatives. In the ﬁrst, there is a sequence (( mn,pn)|n∈N) inN×N×such that\n(m0,p0) = (m,p) and\n(mseqn,pseqn) = (pn,rem(mn,pn)) for all n∈N.\nNowpseqn= rem(mn,pn)< p nfor alln∈N. By Proposition 92G, the sequence\n(pn|n∈N) inN×is strictly antitone; but this is ruled out by the Principle of\nDescent (Proposition 92H). Therefore this alternative is excluded , and we are left\nwith the other: there is a unique number k∈Nandlist((mn,pn)|n∈(seqk)⊏) such\nthat\n(m0,p0) = (m,p)\npn∈N×and (mseqn,pseqn) = (pn,rem(mn,pn)) for all n∈k⊏\npk∈N\\N×={0}.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 168\n158 CHAPTER 9. THE NATURAL NUMBERS\nNow gcd {mseqn,pseqn}= gcd{pn,rem(mn,pn)}= gcd{mn,pn}for alln∈k⊏, accord-\ning to our earlier observation. It then follows at once by induction (a dapted triv-\nially to the index set (seq k)⊏) that gcd {mn,pn}= gcd {m0,p0}= gcd{m,p}for all\nn∈(seqk)⊏. In particular, mk= gcd{mk,0}= gcd{mk,pk}= gcd{m,p}. Ifk= 0,\nwe are in the trivial case p= 0, and verify that gcd {m,p}= gcd{m,0}=m=m0; if\nk/negationslash= 0, we have gcd {m,p}=mk=pk−1.\nWe shall not pursue the discussion of divisibility and the structure of Nordered\nby “divides” at this time. This is a major topic, including such matters a sprime\nnumbers (i.e., the minimal members of N×\\{1}= 2 + Nfor that order) and prime\nfactorization. It will be studied in a broader algebraic context.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 169\nChapter 10\nFINITE SETS\n101. Finite sets and their cardinals\nWe recall (Section 33) that the sets SandTare said to be equinumerous , and\nthatSis said to be equinumerous to T, if there is an invertible mapping from S\ntoTor, equivalently, from TtoS.\nA setSis said to be ﬁnite if there exists an injection from StoNwhose range\nhas an upper bound or, equivalently, if there exists an injection fro mSton⊏for some\nn∈N. A set is said to be inﬁnite if it is not ﬁnite. A family is said to be ﬁnite or\ninﬁnite according as its index set is ﬁnite or inﬁnite.\nIfSis a ﬁnite set, the set {n∈N|there is an injection from Ston⊏}is not\nempty; we deﬁne the cardinal (number )ofSto be the minimum of this set, and\ndenote it by # S; thus\n#S:= min {n∈N|there is an injection from Ston⊏}.\n(Other notations in use for the cardinal of Sare|S|and the unwieldy, obsolescent¯¯S.)\nFor every set S, we denote by F(S) the collection of all ﬁnite subsets of S, i.e.,\nF(S) :={A∈P(S)|Ais ﬁnite };\nwe set F×(S) :=F(S)\\{Ø}, and for every n∈Nwe denote by Fn(S) the collection\nof all ﬁnite subsets of Swhose cardinal is n, i.e.,\nFn(S) :={A∈F(S)|#A=n} for alln∈N.\n101A.

Then n⊏/negationslash= Ø, so that n∈N×.

Therefore ( ω◦φ)|(n−1)⊏:S→(n−1)⊏is\ninjective, and # S≤n−1<n.\nBy contraposition, every injection from Sto (#S)⊏must be surjective, and hence\ninvertible. By the deﬁnition of # S, such an injection exists; it follows that Sand\n(#S)⊏are equinumerous.\n101C. R EMARK . Theorem 101B shows that a set is ﬁnite if and only if it is\nequinumerous to n⊏for somen∈N. This property is often used to deﬁne the\nconcept of ﬁnite set. See also Corollary 101J.\nThe following corollary justiﬁes the term equinumerous (“having equal number”),\nat least for ﬁnite sets.\n101D. C OROLLARY .Let the sets SandTbe given.

We choose an invertible mapping φ:T→(#T)⊏, as we may by Theorem\n101B. Let the injection f:S→Tbe given. Then φ◦f:S→(#T)⊏is an injection.\nIf such an injection fexists, it follows that Sis ﬁnite and # S≤#T.

Therefore seq |n⊐\nn⊏is\nbijective, and n⊏andn⊐are equinumerous. The assertion concerning n⊐now follows\nfrom Corollary 101D. For every n∈N, the set Nincludes the set n⊏, whose cardinal\nisn. By Proposition 101E, Nis inﬁnite.\n101L. R EMARK . One often encounters a ﬁnite set being regarded routinely as\nthe range of a list. This practice is usually unnecessary and indeed dis tracting;\nexceptionally, however, it becomes desirable. Now a ﬁnite set Sis equinumerous\nto (#S)⊏and to (#S)⊐(Theorem 101B and Corollary 101K). For every bijection φ:\n(#S)⊏→Sorφ: (#S)⊐→S, the list (φ(m)|m∈(#S)⊏) or (φ(m)|m∈(#S)⊐),\nof length # S, is called a listing ofS.\n101M. P ROPOSITION .Let the set Sands∈Sbe given. If S\\{s}is ﬁnite, then\nSis ﬁnite and #S= seq#(S\\{s}).\nProof . By Theorem 101B we may choose a bijection φ:S\\{s} →n⊏, where\nn:= #(S\\{s}). We then deﬁne ψ:S→(seqn)⊏by the rule\nψ(x) :=\n\nφ(x) ifx∈S\\{s}\nn ifx=s.\nThenψis bijective. By Proposition 101I, Sis ﬁnite and # S= seqn=\nseq#(S\\{s}).\n101N.

For every n∈(seq#S)⊏, the mapping φ|n⊏\nφ<(n⊏)is a bijection from\nT:=φ<(n⊏)⊂Ston⊏. By Proposition 101I we conclude that Tis ﬁnite and that\n#T=n. Sincen∈(seq#S)⊏was arbitrary, we have proved that {#T|T∈F(S)} ⊃\nS⊃(seq#S)⊏. The reverse inclusion follows from Corollary 101F.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 172\n162 CHAPTER 10. FINITE SETS\nSuppose now that Sis inﬁnite.

LetFbe a collection of ﬁnite sets, and let the non-empty subcollection A\nofFbe given. Deﬁne p:= min {#S|S∈ A} , and choose A∈ A such that # A=p.\nWe claim that Ais a minimal member of A. IfS∈ A satisﬁesS⊂A, then Corollary\n101F implies # S≤#A; but the deﬁnition of pimplies #A=p≤#S. Therefore\n#S= #A, and by Corollary 101F we must have S=A. This establishes our claim.\n102B. T HEOREM .A setSis ﬁnite if and only if P(S), ordered by inclusion, is\nwell-founded.\nProof . IfSis ﬁnite, then Corollary 101F implies that P(S) =F(S). By Theorem\n102A, P(S), ordered by inclusion, is then well-founded.\nAssume, conversely, that P(S), ordered by inclusion is well-founded. If Tis an\ninﬁnite subset of S, we haveT/negationslash= Ø (by Remark 101A), and we may choose t∈T.\nBy Proposition 101M, T\\{t}is also inﬁnite. The collection of all inﬁnite subsets of\nShas therefore no minimal member, and must be empty. In particular ,Sitself is\nﬁnite.\n102C. R EMARK . The characterization of ﬁnite sets by Theorem 102B does not\ninvolve the natural numbers at all. It could be used to deﬁne the concept of ﬁnite\nsets; this has been done occasionally (notably by Wac/suppress law Sierpi´ ns ki (1882-1969)), and\nhas some foundational advantages. We shall take this matter up in Section 106.\nTheorem 102A of course implies the availability of inductive-proof sch emes and\nrecursive deﬁnitions (Chapter 8) for collections of ﬁnite sets. It is convenient to\ndescribe more in detail the inductive-proof schemes for the collect ions of the form\nF(S).\n102D. I NDUCTIVE -PROOF SCHEMES . Let the set Sbe given. By Theorem 102A,\nthe collection F(S), ordered by inclusion, is well-founded. Since every subset of a ﬁnit e\nset is ﬁnite (Corollary 101F), the collection of members of F(S) that strictly precede\na givenA∈F(S) is the collection of its proper subsets, i.e., Spr( A) =P(A)\\{A}.\nIfP( ) is a predicate describing a property that members of F(S) may have, the\nstandard scheme (Inductive-Proof Scheme 81B) for proving tha tP(A) holds for all\nA∈F(S) has the following induction step :\n(102.1) ( ∀B∈P(A)\\{A}, P (B))⇒P(A) for allA∈F(S).\nIn many cases, a stronger induction step (which yields a weaker pro of scheme) is\nmore convenient: To prove that P(A)holds for all A∈F(S)it is enough to prove\nthat the following assertions hold:\n(102.2) P(Ø)\n(102.3) P(A\\{a})⇒P(A) for allA∈F×(S)and alla∈A.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 174\n164 CHAPTER 10. FINITE SETS\nIndeed, (102.2) and (102.3) together imply (102.1). When a distinct ion is necessary, a\nproof using the induction step (102.1) will be called a proof by general induction , and\na proof using (102.2) and the induction step (102.3) will be called a proof by special\ninduction .\n102E. I NDUCTIVE PROOF SCHEMES . It is often desirable to establish a certain\nproperty for allﬁnite sets by an inductive proof. It is not appropriate to attempt\nto do this by applying the Inductive-Proof Schemes 102D to the “se t of all objects”;\na diﬀerent strategy for applying them is required. Suppose, then, thatP( ) is a\npredicate describing a property that ﬁnite sets may have. We asse rt that to prove\nthatP(S)holds for every ﬁnite set Sit is enough to prove\n(102.4) For every ﬁnite set A, (∀B∈P(A)\\{A}, P (B))⇒P(A).\nIndeed, suppose that (102.4) holds, and let the ﬁnite set Sbe given. Then (102.1)\nholds, and therefore P(A) holds for all A∈F(S); in particular, P(S) holds. Proofs\nby this scheme are again called proofs by general induction . If one uses (102.2) and\n(102.3) instead of (102.1), one obtains the corresponding scheme forproofs by special\ninduction: To prove that P(S)holds for every ﬁnite set S, it is enough to prove that\nthe following assertions hold:\n(102.5) P(Ø)\n(102.6)P(A\\{a})⇒P(A)for every non-empty ﬁnite set Aand alla∈A.\nWe record a simple and useful instance of proof by special induction .\n102F. P ROPOSITION .Let the ﬁnite set Sand the non-empty nest Nbe given.\nThenS⊂/uniondisplay\nNif and only if S⊂Afor someA∈ N.\nProof . The “if” part of the statement is trivial.

Operations with ﬁnite sets\nIn this section we show that certain sets constructed from ﬁnite s ets are again\nﬁnite, and that their cardinals can be determined or estimated from the cardinals of\nthe given sets.\n103A. T HEOREM .Let the ﬁnite sets SandTbe given. If SandTare disjoint,\nthenS∪Tis a ﬁnite set, and #(S∪T) = #S+ #T.\nProof . Let the ﬁnite set Tbe given. We prove by special induction that P(S)\nholds for all ﬁnite sets S, where\nP(S) :⇔(S∩T= Ø⇒(S∪Tis ﬁnite and #( S∪T) = #S+ #T)).\nSince Ø ∪T=Tand #Ø = 0, we see that P(Ø) holds.\nLet the non-empty ﬁnite set Sbe given, and let s∈Sbe such that P(S\\{s}) holds.\nIfS∩T= Ø, then ( S\\{s})∩T= Ø and (S∪T)\\{s}= (S\\{s})∪T. SinceS\\{s}is\nﬁnite by Corollary 101F, the induction hypothesis implies that ( S∪T)\\{s}is ﬁnite\nand that #(( S∪T)\\{s}) = #(S\\{s})+#T. By Proposition 101M it follows that S∪T\nis ﬁnite and that #( S∪T) = #((S∪T)\\{s}) + 1 = #(S\\{s}) + 1 + #T= #S+ #T.\nThereforeP(S) holds. This completes the induction step, and P(S) holds for all ﬁnite\nsetsS.\nSinceTwas an arbitrary ﬁnite set, the assertion is proved.\n103B. C OROLLARY .Let the ﬁnite sets SandTbe given. Then S∪TandS∩T\nare ﬁnite sets, and\n(103.1) #( S∪T) + #(S∩T) = #S+ #T.\nProof . By Corollary 101F, S∩TandS\\Tare ﬁnite sets. By Theorem 103A,\nS∪T= (S\\T)∪Tis a ﬁnite set, and\n#S= #(S\\T) + #(S∩T) and #( S\\T) + #T= #(S∪T).\nCombining these equalities, we obtain (103.1).\nThe results that follow have a quantitative aspect that depends on the concepts\nof the sumand the product of a ﬁnite family of natural numbers. These concepts will\nonly be formally introduced in Section 112. Since they are, however, easily accessible\nto our intuition, we have preferred to anticipate their introduction and use them here,\ninstead of deferring the quantitative parts of our results (as we m ight) and having to\ngo over essentially the same proof again. We suppose it to be known t hat for each\nﬁnite family of natural numbers ( ni|i∈I) we are provided with natural numbers/summationdisplay\ni∈Iniand/productdisplay\ni∈Ini, and that these satisfy the following conditions (for deﬁnitions and\nproofs, see Section 112, especially Remark 112C,(b)):\n(103.2)/summationdisplay\nı∈Ini= 0 and/productdisplay\ni∈Ini= 1 ifI= Ø.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 176\n166 CHAPTER 10.

Each of the mappings ( f/mapsto→h←◦f) : Inv(S,T)→Perm(S) and (g/mapsto→h◦\ng) : Perm(S)→Inv(S,T) is the inverse of the other; the same is true of ( f/mapsto→\nf◦h←) : Inv(S,T)→Perm(T) and (g/mapsto→g◦h) : Perm(T)→Inv(S,T).

By Theorem 102A, the la tter is well-\nfounded; hence so is the former.\n105B. C OROLLARY .In every ﬁnite totally ordered set, every non-empty subset\nhas both a maximum and a minimum.\nProof . By Proposition 105A, every ﬁnite totally ordered set is well-ordere d (Propo-\nsition 64A); since the reverse order is also total, the set is also well-o rdered by it. The\nassertion follows at once.\n105C. C OROLLARY .Let the non-empty ﬁnite nest Nbe given. Then/uniondisplay\nN ∈ N\nand/intersectiondisplay\nN ∈ N .\n105D. C OROLLARY .Let the subset SofNbe given.

Then there is\nexactly one order-isomorphism from Sto(#S)⊏.\nProof . We prove by general induction that\nP(S) :⇔(For every total order ≺inSthere is exactly one order-isomorphism\nfromSordered by ≺to (#S)⊏ordered by ≤)\nholds for all ﬁnite sets S.\nLet the ﬁnite set Sbe given, and assume that P(T) holds for all proper subsets\nTofS. LetSbe totally ordered by ≺. IfS= Ø, we have (# S)⊏= Ø, and there is\nexactly one mapping from Sto (#S)⊏, namely 1 Ø; and this mapping is trivially an\norder-isomorphism.\nAssume, then, that S/negationslash= Ø. By Corollary 105B, we may set s:= maxS. By the\ninduction hypothesis applied to the proper subset S\\{s}ofS, there is exactly one\norder-isomorphism ψfromS\\{s}ordered by ≺to (#(S\\{s}))⊏ordered by ≤. We\nrecall that, by Proposition 101M, # S= seq#(S\\{s}).\nSuppose that φ:S→(#S)⊏is an order-isomorphism. Then φ(s) =φ(maxS) =\nmaxφ>(S) = max(#S)⊏= max(seq#( S\\{s}))⊏= #(S\\{s}); therefore φ>(S\\{s}) =\n(seq#(S\\{s}))⊏\\{#(S\\{s})}= (#(S\\{s}))⊏. We conclude that φ|(#(S\\{s}))⊏\nS\\{s}is an\norder-isomorphism, and must therefore be ψ. Henceφmust satisfy\n(105.1) φ(x) =\n\nψ(x) ifx∈S\\{s}\n#(S\\{s}) ifx=s.\nConversely, if φ:S→(#S)⊏isdeﬁned by (105.1), it follows easily from the\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 185\n105.

The proof of the “if” part is a straightforward veriﬁcation, and w ould\nremain valid even if the assumption that Sis ﬁnite were removed. To prove the\n“only if” part, assume that ρis a total order. By Theorem 105E we may choose\norder-isomorphisms φfromSordered by ≺to (#S)⊏ordered by ≤, andψfromS\nordered by ρto (#S)⊏ordered by ≤. Thenπ:=ψ←◦φis an order-isomorphism\nfromSordered by ≺toSordered by ρ, so thatπis a permutation of Sand satisﬁes\n(105.2).\n105G. T HEOREM .A setSis ﬁnite if and only if it can be totally ordered so that\nevery non-empty subset of Shas both a maximum and a minimum.\nProof. Proof of the “only if” part . Let the ﬁnite set Sbe given. By Theorem\n101B we may choose a bijection φ:S→(#S)⊏. We then deﬁne the relation ρinS\nby the rule\n∀x,y∈S, x ρ y :⇔φ(x)≤φ(y).\nIt is clear that ρis a total order in S. The “only if” part of the assertion then follows\nfrom Corollary 105B.\nProof of the “if” part. Assume that the set Sis totally ordered by ≺and that\nevery non-empty subset of Shas both a maximum and a minimum. Consider the\nsubsetU:={x∈S|Ub({x}) is inﬁnite }ofS. Letx∈Ube given. Now Ub( {x})\nis inﬁnite, hence Ub( {x})\\{x}is also inﬁnite (Proposition 101M), and therefore not\nempty. This set then has a minimum, say y, and Ub( {x})\\{x}= Ub( {y}). Thus\nx/precedenotslnteqlyand Ub( {y}) is inﬁnite. Therefore y∈Uandxis not the maximum of U.\nSincex∈Uwas arbitrary, we conclude that Uhas no maximum and is therefore\nempty. This means that Ub( {x}) is ﬁnite for all x∈S.\nIfS= Ø, thenSis ﬁnite. If S/negationslash= Ø, thenS= Ub( {minS}) is ﬁnite.\n105H. R EMARK . Theorem 105G provides another characterization of ﬁnite sets\nthat does not involve the natural numbers. It also has been used t odeﬁne the concept\nof ﬁnite set.\nWe end this section by examining the notion of a family chosen recursively /triangledownsld\n(•Theorem 82H) when the well-founded index set is ﬁnite. It is found, u nsurpris-\ningly, that in this case no appeal to the •Axiom of Choice is needed, but since some\nof the sets involved may be inﬁnite the proof is not an immediate conse quence of the\nPrinciple of Finite Choice (Theorem 103L).\n105I.

By Proposition 105A applied to ( I;/follows) we may choose\na maximal member mof (I;≺). We setI/prime:=I\\{m}and≺/prime:=≺ |I/prime. For every i∈I/prime\nthe set of strict lower bounds of {i}in (I/prime;≺/prime) is obviously the same as in ( I;≺),\nnamely Spr( i). The families ( Ai|i∈I/prime) and (Φ i|i∈I/prime) therefore satisfy (105.3)\nwith (I;≺) replaced by ( I/prime;≺/prime).\nBy the induction hypothesis, P(I/prime) holds, and we may therefore choose b∈×\ni∈I/primeAi\nsuch that\n(105.5) bi∈Φi(b|Spr(i)) for all i∈I/prime.\nSince Spr(m)⊂I/prime, this implies\nbi∈Φi(b|Spr(i)) for all i∈Spr(m);\ntogether with (105.3) this yields Φ m(b|Spr(m))/negationslash= Ø.

Finiteness without counting/triangledownsld\nIn Theorem 102B it was shown that a set Sis ﬁnite if and only if P(S), ordered by\ninclusion, is well-founded; and in Remark 102C it was noted that this ch aracterization,\nwhich contains no reference to natural numbers or to any countin g system, could be\nused — and had indeed be used — to deﬁne the concept of a ﬁnite set. Inasmuch as\nthe existence of a counting system (and hence of the Natural-Num ber System) rests\non foundational agreements such as an Axiom of Inﬁnity (see Sect ion 95), such an\nalternative deﬁnition of ﬁniteness would seem to have merit. It is con tended that\nevery result about ﬁnite sets that does not explicitly involve a count ing system (such\nas one involving the cardinals of ﬁnite sets) can be derived from this a lternative\ndeﬁnition.\nIn this section we intend to illustrate this contention by deriving a res ult describing\nthe “size-comparability” of ﬁnite sets, as well as the Pigeonhole Prin ciple (Corollary\n101H).\nA second purpose of this section is to show that the existence of a c ounting system\n— which would then lead to identifying the alternative deﬁnition, via The orem 102B,\nwith that given in Section 101 — is actually required if the following very modest\nversion of the Axiom of Inﬁnity is accepted: There exists a set that is not ﬁnite\naccording to the alternative deﬁnition.\nIn this section alone , therefore, a set Sis said to be ﬁnite ifP(S), ordered by\ninclusion, is well-founded.

We must show that σ(N)∈N. By Parts (a),\n(b), (c) we have σ(N)∈P(F(S)) andσ(N)/negationslash= Ø. We may choose A∈σ(N) and\na∈Asuch thatA\\{a} ∈ N . It remains to show that\n∀B∈F(S), B∼A⇔B∈σ(N).\nLetB∈F(S) be given. Assume ﬁrst that B∼A; thenB/negationslash= Ø, and we may choose\nb∈B. By Lemma 106I we have B\\{b} ∼A\\{a}, and therefore B\\{b} ∈ N . It\nfollows that B∈σ(N).\nAssume conversely, that B∈σ(N).

Let the subset Σ of N be given, and assume that {Ø} ∈Σ and Seq>(Σ)⊂Σ.\nWe claim that Σ = N, thus establishing (Count III), and completing the proof.\nWe shall prove by special induction that P(A) holds for all A∈F(S), where\nP(A) :⇔ ∃C ∈ Σ, A∈ C.\nNowP(Ø) holds, since {Ø} ∈Σ and Ø ∈ {Ø}. LetA∈F×(S) anda∈Abe given,\nand assume that P(A\\{a}) holds. We may therefore determine C ∈ Σ such that\nA\\{a} ∈ C . By the deﬁnitions of σand Seq, we have A∈σ(C) = Seq C. By the\nassumption on Σ we have Seq C ∈ Σ. ThusP(A) holds, and the induction step is\ncomplete.\nNow let N ∈ N be given, and choose A∈ N. ByP(A) we may determine C ∈Σ\nsuch thatA∈ C. But C ∈N andA∈ C ∩ N . Therefore N=C ∈Σ. Since N ∈ N\nwas arbitrary and Σ ⊂N, we conclude that Σ = N.\n /trianglesolid\nJuly 25, 2013 17:28 WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in icmp12-master\nThis page intentionally left blankThis page intentionally left blank\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 193\nChapter 11\nFINITE SUMS\n111. Commutative monoids\nIn much of mathematics one encounters structures that involve a binary opera-\ntion that is associative and commutative, and an element that acts “ neutrally” in this\noperation; for instance, addition and 0 in N, or multiplication and 1 in N. Such struc-\ntures are a special case of so-called algebraic structures , but here we shall consider\nthem by themselves and only to the extent that is practical for our immediate appli-\ncations. Some more complicated algebraic structures will be introdu ced in Chapter\n13.\nWe deﬁne a commutative monoid (written additively ) to be a set Mendowed\nwith structure by the prescription of a member 0 of Mand a mapping (( x,y)/mapsto→x+y) :\nM×M→M, subject to the following conditions:\n(CM1): ∀x,y,z ∈M,(x+y) +z=x+ (y+z) (associative law )\n(CM2): ∀x,y∈M, x +y=y+x(commutative law )\n(CM3): ∀x∈M, x + 0 =x(neutrality law ).\nOf course (CM2) and (CM3) imply that 0 + x=xfor allx∈M. The commutative\nmonoidMis said to have its zero isolated if\n∀x,y∈M, x +y= 0⇒x=y= 0.\nWe adopt the “additive” notation in the deﬁnition, because it is the on e most\nfrequently occurring in practice. In this notation, 0 is called zero , the mapping\n(x,y)/mapsto→x+yis called addition , andx+yis called the sum ofxandy(and is read\n“xplusy”). Other notations are used when convenient: when + is replaced b y·or\nmere juxtaposition, and 0 by some other symbol (sometimes by 1), one often speaks of\na commutative monoid written multiplicatively ; in this case, the mapping ( x,y)/mapsto→\nx·yis called multiplication , andx·y, usually denoted xy, is called the product\nofxandy, and the member of Mthat plays the part of 0 is called the unity .\n111A. E XAMPLES . (a): Let the set Sbe given. Then P(S) becomes a commuta-\ntive monoid with each of the following choices for “zero” and “plus”: Ø and∪;Sand\n∩; Ø and /triangle(symmetric diﬀerence). The ﬁrst and second of these have their “ zeros”\nisolated, but not the third (unless S= Ø).\n183\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 194\n184 CHAPTER 11.

Finite sums 185\n112. Finite sums\nLetMbe a commutative monoid, written additively. On account of the asso cia-\ntivity and the commutativity of addition we have\n(x+y) +z= (y+x) +z= (z+x) +y= (x+z) +y= (y+z) +x= (z+y) +x=\n=x+ (y+z) =x+ (z+y) =y+ (z+x) =y+ (x+z) =z+ (x+y) =\n=z+ (y+x);\ninformally, we may say “the sum of xandyandzdoes not depend on the listing of\nthe summands or on the priority in performing the operations”. It is to be expected\nthat a similar comment is meaningful and valid for “more than three te rms”; that is,\nfor arbitrary ﬁnite families.\nA precise formulation calls for a deﬁnition of the sum of a ﬁnite family in a\ncommutative monoid or, in a slightly more general and more useful ma nner, the sum\nof an arbitrary family over a ﬁnite subset of its index set. The main pu rpose of this\nsection and the following ones is to develop this deﬁnition and to estab lish useful\nproperties of this concept.\nThe strategy for the deﬁnition is outlined as follows: we ﬁrst deﬁne s ets such as\n{(x+y)+z,...,z +(y+x)}of “all possible sums of the family” and then show, using\nthe associative and commutative laws for addition, that each one of these sets is in\nfact a singleton.\n112A. T HEOREM .LetMbe a commutative monoid, written additively, and let\nthe familya∈MIbe given. Then there is exactly one family σ∈MF(I)such that\n(112.1) σØ= 0\n(112.2) σJ=σJ\\{j}+ajforall J∈F×(I)and all j ∈J.\nProof . 1. The collection F(I), ordered by inclusion, is well-founded (Theorem\n102A). We may therefore, by Theorem 82B, deﬁne the family S∈P(M)F(I)recur-\nsively by the rules\n(112.3) SØ:={0}\n(112.4) SJ:=/uniondisplay\nj∈J{z+aj|z∈SJ\\{j}}for allJ∈F×(I).\nWe prove by general induction (i.e., using the induction step (102.1)) thatSJis\na singleton for every J∈F(I). LetJ∈F(I) be given and assume that SKis a\nsingleton for all proper subsets KofJ. IfJ= Ø, then (112.3) asserts that SJis\na singleton. Assume, therefore, that J/negationslash= Ø. By the induction hypothesis, SJ\\{j}is\na singleton, say {vj}, for eachj∈J. SinceJ/negationslash= Ø, we may choose j/prime∈J; then\nu/prime:=vj/prime+aj/prime∈SJ. Letu∈SJbe given; by (112.4), u=vj+ajfor a suitable j∈J.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 196\n186 CHAPTER 11. FINITE SUMS\nIfj=j/prime, thenvj=vj/primeandu=u/prime. Ifj/negationslash=j/primewe havej∈J\\{j/prime}, j/prime∈J\\{j}, and\n(J\\{j/prime})\\{j}=J\\{j,j/prime}= (J\\{j})\\{j/prime}. By the induction hypothesis, SJ\\{j,j/prime}is\na singleton, say {w}. By (112.4) applied to J\\{j}andJ\\{j/prime}instead ofJ, we ﬁnd\nvj=w+aj/prime,vj/prime=w+aj. Since addition is associative andcommutative , we have in\nthis case\nu=vj+aj= (w+aj/prime)+aj=w+(aj/prime+aj) =w+(aj+aj/prime) = (w+aj)+aj/prime=vj/prime+aj/prime=u/prime.\nIn either case, therefore, we ﬁnd u=u/prime. Sinceu∈SJwas arbitrary, we conclude that\nSJ={u/prime}is a singleton. This completes the induction step. Hence SJis a singleton\nfor everyJ∈F(I).\n2. On account of what we have just proved, we may deﬁne the family s∈MF(I)\nbysJ:∈SJfor allJ∈F(I). From (112.3) and (112.4) we then obtain\n(112.5) sØ∈SØ={0}\n(112.6) sJ\\{j}+aj∈SJ={sJ}for allJ∈F×(I) and allj∈J.\nThereforeσ:=ssatisﬁes (112.1) and (112.2).\nOn the other hand, suppose that σ∈MF(I)satisﬁes (112.1) and (112.2). We then\nprove by special induction that σJ=sJfor allJ∈F(I); this will end the proof. By\n(112.1) and (112.5) we have σØ= 0 =sØ. LetJ∈F×(I) be given and let j∈Jbe\nsuch thatσJ\\{j}=sJ\\{j}. By (112.2) and (112.6), σJ=σJ\\{j}+aj=sJ\\{j}+aj=sj.\nThis completes the induction step.\nFor every family a∈MIwe now deﬁne\n/summationdisplay\nJa:=σJ for allJ∈F(I),\nwhereσ∈MF(I)is the unique family satisfying (112.1) and (112.2). We call/summationdisplay\nJathe\nsum of the familyaoverJ.\nIf additive notation is not used, a symbol other than/summationdisplay\nis customary. In partic-\nular, when the commutative monoid is written multiplicatively, the symb ol/productdisplay\nand\nthe term product instead of sum are usual.\nWe now rewrite (112.1) and (112.2) in the newly introduced notation:\n(112.7)/summationdisplay\nØa= 0\n(112.8)/summationdisplay\nJa=/summationdisplay\nJ\\{j}a+ajfor allJ∈F×(I) and allj∈J.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 197\n112.

Sums of families with ﬁnite support 189\nProof . (i)⇒(ii). The proof that τ, as deﬁned by (i), satisﬁes (113.2) is the same,\nwith minor adjustments, as the proof of Proposition 113A. If J∈P(I\\Suppa), we\nhaveτJ=/summationdisplay\nØa= 0, so that τalso satisﬁes (113.1).\n(ii)⇒(iii). This follows trivially by setting K:= Suppa.\n(iii)⇒(i). Let the ﬁnite subset KofIbe chosen so that τsatisﬁes (113.3). If\nj∈Suppa, we haveτØ= 0, by (113.3) and therefore, by (113.2), τ{j}=τØ+aj=aj/negationslash=0.\nTherefore (113.3) implies that {j}/∈P(I\\K), i.e., that j∈K. Sincej∈Suppawas\narbitrary, we have proved that Supp a⊂K. Therefore Proposition 113A, applied to\nJ∩Kinstead ofJ, shows that\n/summationdisplay\nJ∩Supp aa=/summationdisplay\nJ∩Ka for allJ∈P(I).\nTo prove that (i) holds it will therefore be enough to prove that τJ=/summationdisplay\nJ∩Kafor all\nJ∈P(I). We prove this by proving by special induction that\nP(A) :⇔(∀J∈P(I), J∩K=A⇒τJ=/summationdisplay\nAa)\nholds for all A∈P(K) =F(K).\nIfJ∈P(I) andJ∩K= Ø, thenJ∈P(I\\K), and (113.3) implies τJ= 0 =/summationdisplay\nØa,\nso thatP(Ø) holds.

The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nIn Corollary 103E we proved that the union of a ﬁnite family of ﬁnite se ts is ﬁnite.\nIn Sections 112 and 114 we have developed the machinery that allows us to provide a\nprecise determination of the cardinal of such a union, as a generaliz ation of Corollary\n103B. We therefore interrupt the general account of ﬁnite sums (the remainder of the\nchapter being largely concerned with additional “bookkeeping” issu es) to provide this\nprecise determination, a result known as the Inclusion-Exclusion Pr inciple.\nIt happens that both the formulation of the Inclusion-Exclusion Pr inciple and its\nproof are facilitated by the use of (positive and negative) integers instead of restricting\nall terms to be members of N. The reader’s indulgence is requested with regard to\nthis foray into formally as-yet-undeﬁned terrain. The concerned reader may, in fact,\nreadily convert all statements and arguments in the following accou nt into statements\nand arguments about natural numbers; the exercise is straightf orward, but rather\nannoying. To satisfy that reader’s curiosity, a “natural-number” formulation of the\nInclusion-Exclusion Principle is recorded in Remark 116C.\nWe propose to give three separate proofs of this important result , as an illustration\nof the diversity of approaches in this combinatorial context.\n116A.

In such structure s it is still possible —\nindeed interesting — to deﬁne sums of ﬁnite families, provided they are not empty .\nInstead of developing the theory of these sums independently, as we might, we reduce\nit to the theory of ﬁnite sums in a commutative monoid, as described in the preceding\nsections. We preserve the additive notation, but the same remark s made before about\nother terminology and notation remain valid.\nWe deﬁne a commutative semigroup (written additively) to be a set M\nendowed with structure by the prescription of a mapping (( x,y)/mapsto→x+y) :M×M→\nM, subject to the conditions (CM1) (associative law) and (CM2) (com mutative law)\nin Section 111.\nThe device that will enable us to reduce the work with sums in a commut ative\nsemigroup to the previous work in commutative monoids is the following construction.\nThroughout this section we shall assume that it has been carried ou t.\n118A.

We shall not engage at this point in a thorough study of su chalgebraic\nstructures , but shall develop only so much of the terminology, notation, and “b ook-\nkeeping” properties as is needed as background for the account o f the Real-Number\nSystem in the next three chapters; a second purpose, achieved a t no additional ex-\npense, is to provide information required for use in linear algebra. We shall require,\nfrom Section 111, the deﬁnition of commutative monoid , as well as the terminology,\nnotation, and results in Sections 111-115 and 117.\nWe record some notational conventions used in connection with com mutative\nmonoids. Let the commutative monoid M, written additively, be given. By virtue of\nthe associative law we may write expressions such as x+y+zfor allx,y,z ∈M,\nomitting parentheses without danger of ambiguity. Similarly, we may w ritemnx for\nallx∈Mandm,n∈N, by virtue of Proposition 115B,(b).\nFor all subsets A, B ofMand all subsets SofNwe write\nA+B:={x+y|(x,y)∈A×B}\nSA :={nx|(n,x)∈S×A}\nA×:=A\\{0}.\nIn the ﬁrst and second formulas, braces are often omitted when e xactly one of the\nsets is recorded as being a singleton: thus, with a,b∈Mandn∈Nwe write\na+B:={a}+B, A +b:=A+{b}, nA :={n}A, Sa :=S{a}.\nIn multiplicative notation, we use xyzunambiguously without parentheses, and\n221\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 232\n222 CHAPTER 13. SOME ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURES\nset\nAB:={xy|(x,y)∈A×B}\nandaB:={a}BandAb:=A{b}; but no multiplicative analogues of SAandA×are\nin use. (In particular, the notation ASis reserved for other uses: see Section 44.)\nReturning to additive notation, we generalize the notation A+Bas follows. Let\nthe family ( Ai|i∈I) of subsets of Mbe given. We deﬁne\n/summationdisplay\ni∈IAi:={/summationdisplay\ni∈Iai|a∈M(I)∩×\ni∈IAi} ⊂M\n(we recall that M(I):={a∈MI|Suppais ﬁnite }). If, in particular, Iis ﬁnite, we\nhave /summationdisplay\ni∈IAi={/summationdisplay\ni∈Iai|a∈×\ni∈IAi}.\nWarning : IfAis a subset of M, we most often have 2 A/negationslash=A+A; more generally, we\nusually have nA/negationslash=/summationdisplay\nk∈n⊏Afor a given n∈N.\nWe deﬁne a commutative group (written additively) to be a commutative\nmonoidG, written additively, endowed with additional structure by the pres cription\nof a mapping ( x/mapsto→ −x) :G→G, subject to the following condition:\n(CG) : ∀x∈G, x + (−x) = 0 (law of opposites ).\nOf course (CM2) and (CG) imply that ( −x) +x= 0 for allx∈G.\nWe again adopt the “additive” notation in this deﬁnition, because it is t he one\nthat occurs most frequently in practice. In this notation, the map pingx/mapsto→ −xis\ncalled opposition , and −xis called the opposite of x, and is read “ minusx”.\n(The barbarism “negative of x” or, worse, “negative x”, for −xis to be avoided:\nthere usually is nothing negative about −x.) When multiplicative notation is used,\none uses the term reciprocal instead of opposite ; the reciprocal of a member xof the\ngroup is never denoted by −x, but the notation varies.\n131A. E XAMPLES . (a): Let the Sbe given. Then P(S) becomes a commutative\ngroup with Ø as zero, symmetric diﬀerence as addition, and the ident ity mapping\n1P(S)as opposition (Proposition 16E).\n(b)∗: The sets R,Q,Z, each with the number 0 as zero, and with the usual\naddition and opposition of real numbers, suitably adjusted, are co mmutative groups\nwritten additively. The sets R×,P×,Q×,{1,−1}, each with the number 1 as unity\nand multiplication of real numbers and reciprocation of non-zero re al numbers, suit-\nably adjusted, are commutative groups written multiplicatively.\n(c): A doubleton {even, odd }, with even as zero, addition deﬁned by the rules\neven + even := odd + odd := even, even + odd := odd + even := odd, and opp osition\ndeﬁned to be the identity mapping, is a commutative group written ad ditively. (Valid\nbut disingenuous disclaimer: “Any resemblance is purely coincidental” .)\nLet the commutative group G, written additively, be given. We deﬁne the mapping\n((x,y)/mapsto→x−y) :G×G→G, called subtraction , by the rule\nx−y:=x+ (−y) for all x,y∈G.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 233\n131. Commutative monoids and groups 223\nWe callx−ythediﬀerence of xandy(read “xminusy”). In particular (CG)\nimplies\nx−x= 0 for all x∈G.\nIf multiplicative notation is used, subtraction is replaced by division ,diﬀerence by\nquotient , “minus ” by “ over ” or “ upon” or “ divided by ”; the notation for the quotient\nofxandyis usuallyx/yorx\ny.\nWe return to additive notation. On the understanding that addition and sub-\ntraction are performed sequentially “from left to right”, we omit pa rentheses in such\nexpressions as x+y−z:= (x+y)−z,−x−y−z:= ((−x)−y)−z, etc.\nFor subsets A, B of a commutative group written additively, we set\n−A:={−x|x∈A}\nA−B:=A+ (−B) ={x−y|(x,y)∈A×B};\nand ifa, b are members of the group, we again abbreviate thus: a−B:={a}−B,\nA−b:=A− {b}. No multiplicative analogues of these notations are in use.\nOur next result expresses one of the most fundamental propert ies of commutative\ngroups.\n131B. P ROPOSITION .Let the commutative group G, written additively, be given.\nFor alla,b∈G, the equation\n?x∈G, a +x=b\nhas exactly one solution, namely b−a.\nProof . For every x∈G, ifa+x=b, thenx=x+0 =x+a+(−a) = (a+x)−a=\nb−a. On the other hand, a+ (b−a) =b+ (−a) +a=b+ 0 =b. Therefore a+x=b\nif and only if x=b−a.\n131C.

Commutative rings 225\n132. Commutative rings\nWe deﬁne a commutative ring to be a commutative group A, written additively ,\nendowed, in addition (no pun intended!), with the structure of a com mutative monoid,\nwritten multiplicatively , subject to the following condition:\n(CR) : ∀x,y,z ∈A, (x+y)z= (xz) + (yz) ( distributive law ).\nOf course the distributive law and the commutative law for multiplicatio n imply that\nz(x+y) = (zx) + (zy) for allx,y,z ∈A.\nWe adopt the usual convention concerning parentheses: in the ab sence of paren-\ntheses indicating the contrary, multiplication is to be executed with p riority over\naddition, subtraction and opposition. Thus, the right-hand side of (CR) may be\nwrittenxz+yz.\nA commutative ring with 0 as its only member is said to be trivial .\n132A. E XAMPLES . (a): Let the set Sbe given. The P(S) becomes a commu-\ntative ring with Ø as zero, symmetric diﬀerence as addition, the ident ity mapping\nas opposition, Sas unity, and intersection as multiplication (Proposition 16E). This\ncommutative ring is trivial if and only if S= Ø.\n(b)∗: The set Z, with the usual zero, addition, opposition, and multiplication, and\nwith 1 as unity, is a commutative ring.\nWe record some simple consequences of the deﬁnition.\n132B. P ROPOSITION .Let the commutative ring Abe given. For all x,y,z ∈A\nwe have\n(132.1) 0 x= 0where 0is the zero of A\n(132.2) ( −x)y=x(−y) =−xy and (−x)(−y) =xy\n(132.3) ( x−y)z=xz−yz.\nProof . For every x∈Athe distributive law yields\n0x+ 0x= (0 + 0)x= 0x= 0x+ 0,\nand the cancellation law for addition shows that 0 x= 0. This establishes (132.1).\nLetx,y,z ∈Abe given. The distributive law and (132.1) yield\nxy+ (−x)y= (x+ (−x))y= 0y= 0 =xy+ (−xy),\n(x−y)z+yz= (x−y+y)z= (x+ 0)z=xz=xz+ 0 =xz−yz+yz,\nand the cancellation law shows that ( −x)y=−xyand (x−y)z=xz−yz. This estab-\nlishes part of (132.2) and also (132.3). The rest of (132.2) follows by the commutative\nlaw of multiplication.\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 236\n226 CHAPTER 13. SOME ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURES\nIn (132.1), 0 xwas the product of the members 0 and xofA; (132.1) shows that\nthere is no notational clash with 0 x, the 0th natural multiple of x, which is also 0 ∈A,\nby (115.2).\n132C.

Introduction\nThe purpose of this chapter and the next is to introduce the syste msR,Q, andZ\nof real numbers, of rational numbers, and of integers, respect ively, without engaging\nin a thorough or prolonged discussion of their properties.\nOf the various methods in current use for the introduction of the R eal-Number\nSystem, we adopt one that stresses the operational structure of the system, rather\nthan one that purports to address the question of what real num bers “really are”. We\ntherefore introduce the Real-Number System Ras an instance of a complete ordered\nﬁeld, as deﬁned in Section 143. We encounter here the same questions t hat we ad-\ndressed when we introduced the Natural-Number System as an inst ance of a counting\nsystem in Chapter 9. One is the question regarding the “ essential uniqueness ” of a\ncomplete ordered ﬁeld: we shall show that any two complete ordere d ﬁelds are nat-\nurally isomorphic as regards their complete-ordered-ﬁeld structu re (Section 144) —\nalthough they may in other respects be quite diﬀerent. Once this is s hown, it matters\nlittle which particular complete ordered ﬁeld we accept, by choice, by construction,\nor by authority, as being theReal-Number System.\nThe question regarding the existence of a complete ordered ﬁeld then remains.\nWe judged the corresponding question regarding the existence of a counting system\nto be a foundational issue, beyond the scope of this work. We take very much the\nsame view of our current existence question, but we shall establish that the two\nproblems are equivalent, by (a) showing that every complete order ed ﬁeld “includes”\na counting system, and (b) showing how to construct a complete or dered ﬁeld from a\ncounting system. We regard this analysis of the existence question as tangential to our\nchief concerns, and therefore relegate the execution of the build ing process (b) to an\nappendix (Chapter 16). Both here and in the proof of the natural- isomorphism result\nmentioned before we use a quite faithful adaptation of the theory of ratios attributed\nto Eudoxos (E´ υδoξoς , 4th century B.C.E.), which gave the ﬁrst eﬀective account of\nwhat we call positive irrational numbers ( irrational , when applied to numbers, means\n231\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 242\n232 CHAPTER 14.

We subscribe to this view, which we shall discuss\nfurther in Section 151. This view rules out, however, a traditional v ersion of the\nbuilding process (b), one that starts from the Natural-Number Sy stemNitself and\nproceeds by successive construction of Z,Q, andR(Zis sometimes skipped) in such\na way that none of these sets is a subset of any other. This version , even when\nadjusted by suitable modiﬁcations to circumvent this obstacle, is no t, in our view, so\nstraightforward as the one we have adopted.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 243\n142. Ordered ﬁelds 233\n142. Ordered ﬁelds\nWe deﬁne an ordered ﬁeld to be a ﬁeld Fendowed with additional structure by\nthe prescription of a subset PofF, called the positive half of F, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n(OF1) : P+P⊂P\n(OF2) : PP⊂P\n(OF3) : P∩(−P) ={0}\n(OF4) : P∪(−P) =F.\nConditions (OF1) and (OF2) are often expressed by saying that Pis stable with\nrespect to addition and multiplication .\nIn this section and in the next, whenever Fdenotes an ordered ﬁeld, the unity of\nFand the positive half of Fwill always be denoted by eandP, respectively.\n142A. L EMMA .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. Then\n(141.1) F\\P=−P×F\\P×=−P\n(142.2) P×∪ {0} ∪(−P×) =F\n(142.3) P+P×⊂P×\n(142.4) P×P×⊂P×\n(142.5) ∀x,y∈P×, x/y ∈P×.\nProof . (142.1) and (142.2) follow immediately from (OF3) and (OF4). Let x,y∈P\nbe given, so that x+y∈Pby (OF1). If x+y= 0, theny=−x∈ −P, and by\n(OF3) we ﬁnd y= 0. Thus y∈P×impliesx+y∈P×. Sincex,y∈Pwere\narbitrary, this establishes (142.3). By (OF2), P×P×⊂PP⊂P; but by Corollary\n133D,P×P×⊂F×F×⊂F×. HenceP×P×⊂P∩F×=P×. This establishes\n(142.4). Let x∈Fandy∈P×be given. If x/y∈F\\P×=−P, thenx=y(x/y)∈\nP×(−P) =−P×P⊂ −P=F\\P×; hencex∈P×impliesx/y∈P×. This establishes\n(142.5).\nLet the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. We deﬁne the relation <inFby the rule\n∀x,y∈F, x<y :⇔y−x∈P×.\nThe term ordered ﬁeld is justiﬁed by the following result.\n142B. P ROPOSITION .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. Then <is a total strict\norder inF.\nProof . For allx∈Fwe havex−x= 0/∈P×, so that<is irreﬂexive. Let x,y∈F\nbe given. By (142.2), either y−x∈P×ory−x= 0 orx−y=−(y−x)∈P×.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 244\n234 CHAPTER 14. THE REAL NUMBERS: COMPLETE ORDERED FIELDS\nHence<is total. Let x,y,z ∈Fbe given, and assume that x<y andy <z . Then\nz−x= (z−y) + (y−x)∈P×+P×⊂P×, by (142.3). Therefore <is transitive.\nWe denote the (lax) order corresponding to the strict-order <inFby≤(the\nnotation /lessdblequalis also in common use). We shall always regard the set Fas ordered by\n≤. We ﬁnd\n∀x,y∈F, x ≤y⇔y−x∈P,\nP= Ub( {0}).\nA member of Fis said to be positive, negative, strictly positive, strictly neg-\native if it is inP,−P, P×,−P×, respectively. (A conﬂicting convention that is\nnot uncommon, but that we do not use, employs the respective ter msnon-negative,\nnon-positive, positive, negative instead; it is mannerly to declare one’s choice between\nthese conventions when confusion might otherwise arise.)\n142C. P ROPOSITION .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. Then the following mono-\ntonicity laws hold:\n(142.6) ∀x,y,z ∈F, x<y ⇔x+z <y +z⇔x−z <y−z\n(142.7) ∀x,y∈F, x<y ⇔ −y<−x\n(142.8) ∀x,y∈F,∀z∈P×, x<y ⇔xz <yz ⇔x/z <y/z\n(142.9) ∀x,y∈F,∀u,v∈P×, vx<uy ⇔x/u<y/v.\nProof . For allx,y,z ∈Fwe have (y+z)−(x+z) = (y−z)−(x−z) =y−xand\n(−x)−(−y) =−x+y=y−x; this establishes (142.6) and (142.7). Let x,y∈Fand\nz∈P×be given. If x<y , thenyz−xz= (y−x)z∈P×P×⊂P×, by (142.4), and\nhencexz <yz ; if, on the other hand, x≥y, thenxz−yz= (x−y)z∈PP⊂P, and\nhencexz≥yz. This shows that x < y ⇔xz < yz . Applying this equivalence to\nx/zandy/zinstead ofxandy, we ﬁnd that x/z <y/z ⇔x<y . This establishes\n(142.8). Let x,y∈Fandu,v∈P×be given. Then uv∈P×by (142.4), and by\n(142.8)vx<uy if and only if x/u= (vx)/(vu)<(uy)/(uv) =y/v. This establishes\n(142.9).\n142D. P ROPOSITION .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given.\n(a): for everyx∈Fwe havexx∈P.\n(b):e∈P×; for allx∈P×we havee/x∈P×.\n(c):The mapping (x/mapsto→xx) :P→Pis strictly isotone, hence injective.\nProof. Proof of (a). Letx∈Fbe given. By (OF4) and (OF2) we have xx∈\n(PP)∪((−P)(−P)) = (PP)∪(PP) =PP⊂P.\nProof of (b). By (a), e=ee∈P, bute/negationslash= 0, hence e∈P×. The remaining\nassertion follows from (142.5).\nProof of (c). Letx,y∈Pbe given, and assume that x < y . Theny−x∈P×,\nandy+x= (y−x) +x+x∈P×+P+P⊂P×, by (142.3).

Thus (x/mapsto→xx) :P→P\nis strictly isotone. Since Pis totally ordered, this mapping is injective (Remark\n62A,(a)).\n142E. T HEOREM .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. Set\n(142.10) N:=/intersectiondisplay\n{A∈P(F)|0∈A, A +e⊂A},\nthe smallest member of the intersection-stable collection A:={A∈P(F)|0∈A,\nA+e⊂A}. Then 0∈N, N +e⊂N⊂P; and the set N, with 0as zero and the\nmapping (x/mapsto→x+e) :N→Nas successor-mapping, is a counting system.\nProof . The collection Ais obviously intersection-stable, and hence N∈ A, so\nthat 0 ∈NandN+e⊂N. By Proposition 142D,(b) we have e∈P×and hence,\nby (OF1),P+e⊂P+P⊂P; by (OF3) we have 0 ∈P. ThusP∈ A, and hence\nN⊂P.\nDeﬁneσ:N→Nby the rule σ(x) :=x+efor allx∈N. Then Rng σ=\nN+e⊂P+P×⊂P×, by (142.3). Hence 0 /∈Rngσ, and (Count I) holds for the\nproposed counting system; σis injective, by the cancellation law for addition in F,\nso that (Count II) holds. If Sis a subset of Nsuch that 0 ∈Sandσ>(S)⊂S, then\nS+e⊂S, so thatS∈ A. HenceN⊂S⊂N, and equality holds, thus (Count III)\nalso holds for N, with 0 and σ.\nThe next result shows that the mapping ( n/mapsto→ne) :N→Fpermits an identiﬁca-\ntion of Nwith the counting system described in Theorem 142E. (We do not act ually\nmake this identiﬁcation, in which nwould serve as a symbol for nefor eachn∈N,\nat this time; but see Section 151.)\n142F. P ROPOSITION .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given, and let the subset NofF\nbe deﬁned by (142.10). ThenNe=N(so that Ne⊂P), and the mapping (n/mapsto→ne) :\nN→Neis an order-isomorphism. Moreover,\n(142.11) 0 e= 0 1 e=e\n(142.12)∀m,n∈N,(m+n)e=me+ne (mn)e= (me)(ne)mne= (me)n\n(142.13) ∀m,n∈N, m≥n⇒(m−n)e=me−ne.\nProof . We note that (142.11) follows from (115.2); the ﬁrst part of (142 .12)\nfrom Proposition 115B,(a); the second part of (142.12) from Prop osition 132D,(c);\nand (142.13) from (131.7). The third part of (142.12) follows from t he second by\ninduction: the core of the induction step reads\nmseqne= (mnm)e= (mne)(me) = (me)n(me) = (me)seqn.\nWe now prove the ﬁrst part of the statement. Theorem 142E desc ribes the count-\ning system N, and asserts that N⊂P. By Theorem 95A, there exists exactly one\nmappingφ:N→Nsuch thatφ(0) = 0 and φ(seqn) =φ(n)+efor alln∈N, and this\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 246\n236 CHAPTER 14. THE REAL NUMBERS: COMPLETE ORDERED FIELDS\nmapping is bijective. We now prove that φ(n) =nefor alln∈N; this will show that\nNe=N. By (142.11), φ(0) = 0 = 0 e. Letn∈Nbe such that φ(n) =ne. By (142.11)\nand (142.12) we then have φ(seqn) =φ(n) +e=ne+ 1e= (n+ 1)e= (seqn)e. This\ncompletes the induction step.\nIt remains to prove that φis an order-isomorphism. Let m,n∈Nbe given. If\nm≥n, then (142.13) yields me−ne= (m−n)e∈Ne⊂P, and hence me≥ne.\nThusφis isotone. Since Nis totally ordered and φis bijective, φis indeed an order-\nisomorphism (Proposition 62D).\n142G. C OROLLARY .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given.\n(a): The following cancellation laws hold:\n(142.14) ∀n∈N×,∀x,y∈F, nx =ny⇒x=y\n(142.15) ∀x∈F×,∀m,n∈N, mx =nx⇒m=n.\n(b):N×P×⊂P×, and the following monotonicity laws hold:\n(142.16) ∀n∈N×,∀x,y∈F, x<y ⇔nx<ny\n(142.17) ∀x∈P×,∀m,n∈N, m<n ⇔mx<nx.\nProof . By Proposition 142F, the mapping ( n/mapsto→ne) :N→Pis injective. Hence\nN×e= (Ne)\\{0e} ⊂P×. Then N×P×= (N×e)P×⊂P×P×⊂P×by (142.4).\nMoreover, (142.14), (142.15) then follow from the cancellation law f or multiplication,\nand (142.16), (142.17) from (142.8) and the fact that ( n/mapsto→ne) :N→Neis an\norder-isomorphism. For instance, if x∈P×andm,n∈Nare given, we have\nm<n ⇔me<ne ⇔mx= (me)x<(ne)x=nx.\n142H. P ROPOSITION .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. The order ≤inFis dense.\nProof . By Proposition 142D,(b) and Corollary 142G,(b) we have 2 e∈P×. Let\nx,y∈Fbe given, and assume that x<y , so thaty−x∈P×. Setz:= (x+y)/(2e).\nThenz−x=y−z= (y−x)/(2e)∈P×; hencex<z <y .\nLet the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given.

We shall only prove that |x+y| ≤ |x|+|y|for allx,y∈F. We have\nx≤ |x|,−x≤ |x|, y≤ |y|,−y≤ |y|, and therefore, by (142.6), x+y≤ |x|+|y|and\n−(x+y) =−x−y≤ |x|+|y|; hence |x+y|= max {x+y,−(x+y)} ≤ |x|+|y|.\nAn ordered ﬁeld Fis said to be archimedean if Ub(Ne) = Ø. (By the testimony\nof Archimedes himself, this property of the ﬁeld of real numbers, in the variant form\nused by him, was used earlier by Eudoxos.) The essential property o f archimedean\nordered ﬁelds is given in the following result.\n142J. P ROPOSITION .Let the archimedean ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. If x,y∈P\nandx<y , then there exist p,q∈N×such thatqx<pe<qy .\nThis proposition can be roughly restated thus: Between any two distinct members\nofPthere is another of the form (pe)/(qe), withp,q∈N×.\nProof . We havey−x∈P×. SinceFis archimedean, we may choose q∈N×such\nthatqe>e/ (y−x). By (142.8) and (131.6) we have qy−qx=q(y−x) = (qe)(y−x)>\ne, and hence qx+e < qy by (142.6). Again since Fis archimedean, we may deﬁne\np:= min {n∈N|ne>qx }. Since 0e= 0≤qxby Corollary 142G, we have p∈N×,\nandpe−e= (p−1)e≤qx. Therefore (142.6) yields qx<pe ≤qx+e<qy .\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 248\n238 CHAPTER 14. THE REAL NUMBERS: COMPLETE ORDERED FIELDS\n143. Complete ordered ﬁelds\nAn ordered ﬁeld Fis said to be complete if the ordered set Fis pre-completely\nordered.\nIfFis an ordered ﬁeld, then x<x +efor everyx∈F, so thatFhas no maximum\nand cannot, therefore, be a completely ordered set. The term “complete”, as deﬁned\nhere, may thus be somewhat ill-ﬁtting, but it is not actually misleading; we therefore\nadhere to this traditional terminology.\n143A. L EMMA .Let the ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. The following statements are\nequivalent:\n(i):Fis a complete ordered ﬁeld.\n(ii): The ordered subset PofFis pre-completely ordered.\n(iii): Every closed order-interval of Fis completely ordered.\n(iv): The closed order-interval [ [0,e] ]ofFis completely ordered.\nProof .Fis totally ordered, and every closed order-interval of Pis a closed order-\ninterval ofF. From Proposition 72J we infer the implications (i) ⇔(iii)⇒(ii)⇒(iv).\nIt remains to prove that (iv) implies (iii). Let the closed order-interv al [ [a,b] ] ofFbe\ngiven. Since singleton subsets of Fare completely ordered, we may assume that a<b .\nThe mappings ( x/mapsto→a+ (b−a)x) :F→Fand (x/mapsto→(x−a)/(b−a)) :F→Fare\nisotone, by Proposition 142C, and each is the inverse of the other. They are therefore\norder-isomorphisms, and the former induces an order-isomorphis m from [ [0,e] ] onto\n[ [a,b] ]. If [ [0,e] ] is completely ordered, it follows that [ [ a,b] ] is completely ordered.\n143B. P ROPOSITION .Let the complete ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. Every order-\nconvex subset of Fis either empty or a singleton or an uncountable set. In parti cular,\nFis uncountable.\nProof . Let the order-convex subset AofFbe given. By Proposition 72J, Ais\ntotally and pre-completely ordered by ≤; by Proposition 142H, this order is dense.\nThe conclusion follows by Corollary 122G.\n143C. P ROPOSITION .Let the complete ordered ﬁeld Fbe given. The mapping\n(x/mapsto→x2) :P→Pis an order-isomorphism.\nProof . By Proposition 142D,(c), the mapping is (strictly) isotone and injec tive.\nSincePis totally ordered, it will be enough to show that the mapping is surjec tive.\n(Proposition 62D).\nLety∈Pbe given. Set a:= max {e,y} ∈P×. Theny=ey≤ay≤a2, by\n(142.8). For all t∈Pwe haveat+y∈P, t+a∈P×, by (OF1), (OF2), and (142.3).\nBy (142.5) we may deﬁne the mapping f: [ [0,a] ]→Pby the rule\nf(t) := (at+y)/(t+a) =a−(a2−y)/(t+a) for all t∈[ [0,a] ].\nWe see that Rng f⊂[ [0,a] ]. By Proposition 142C, applied repeatedly, we infer that f\nis (strictly) isotone.\nBy Lemma 143A, [ [0 ,a] ] is completely ordered. By the Knaster Fixed-Point The-\norem (Theorem 75A), we may choose a ﬁxed point xof the isotone mapping f|[ [0,a] ].\nThen (ax+y)/(x+a) =x, and hence x2=y.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 249\n143.

The mapping ( y/mapsto→√\ny) :P→P\nis the inverse of ( x/mapsto→x2) :P→P, and is therefore an order-isomorphism.\n143D. P ROPOSITION .Every complete ordered ﬁeld is archimedean.\nProof . Let the complete ordered ﬁeld F, with unity e, be given. Since Ne+e⊂Ne,\nwe have Ub( Ne+e)⊃Ub(Ne). But the mapping ( x/mapsto→x−e) :F→Fis an order-\nisomorphism, by Proposition 142C (its inverse is ( x/mapsto→x+e) :F→F), and therefore\n(143.1) Ub( Ne) = Ub( Ne+e−e) = Ub( Ne+e)−e⊃Ub(Ne)−e.\nSincee∈P×(Proposition 142D,(b)), it follows from (143.1) that Ub( Ne) has no\nminimum; hence Nehas no supremum. Since Fis pre-completely ordered and Ne/negationslash=Ø,\nit follows that Ub( Ne) = Ø.\n143E. P ROPOSITION .Let the complete ordered ﬁeld and the mapping ρ:F→F\nbe given.

We have therefore neither qx < pe < q (ρ(x)/ρ(e)) norqx > pe >\nq(ρ(x)/ρ(e)). Sincep,q∈N×were arbitrary and Fis archimedean, it follows from\nProposition 142J that x=ρ(x)/ρ(e); thusρ(x) =xρ(e) in this case too.\nWe have shown that ρ(x) =xρ(e) for allx∈P.

THE REAL NUMBERS: COMPLETE ORDERED FIELDS\nFor the proof of this theorem we shall rely on three lemmas. In each of them,F\nandF1are given complete ordered ﬁelds, with respective zeros 0 and 0 1, unitieseand\ne1, and positive halves PandP1.\n144B. L EMMA .There exists a mapping ω:P→P1such that\n(144.12) ∀x∈P,∀m,n∈N×,\n\nme≤nx⇒me1≤nω(x)\nme≥nx⇒me1≥nω(x).\nProof . Letx∈Pbe given. Since Fis archimedean (Proposition 143D), there exist\nm/prime,n/prime∈N×such thatm/primee≥n/primex(even with n/prime:= 1). For all such m/prime, n/prime, and for all\nm,n∈N×withme≤nx, we have, by (142.16), n/primeme≤n/primenx=nn/primex≤nm/primee; it fol-\nlows by (142.17) that n/primem≤nm/prime, and consequently ( n/primee1)(me1) =n/primeme1≤nm/primee1=\n(ne1)(m/primee1); and hence, by (142.9), ( me1)/(ne1)≤(m/primee1)/(n/primee1). We conclude that\nthe subset {(me1)/(ne1)|m,n∈N×, me≤nx}ofP1has an upper bound. Since P1\nis pre-completely ordered (Lemma 143A) and has the minimum 0 1, this subset has a\nsupremum.\nWe may therefore deﬁne ω:P→P1by the rule\nω(x) := sup {(me1)/(ne1)|m,n∈N×, me≤nx}for allx∈P.\nLetx∈Pandm/prime,n/prime∈N×be given. If m/primee≤n/primex, then (m/primee1)/(n/primee1)≤ω(x), and\nhence, by (142.8), m/primee1≤(n/primee1)ω(x) =n/primeω(x). If, on the other hand, m/primee≥n/primex, we\nshowed in the preceding paragraph that ( me1)/(ne1)≤(m/primee1)/(n/primee1) for allm,n∈\nN×withme≤nx; and therefore ω(x)≤(m/primee1)/(n/primee1), and consequently m/primee1≥\n(n/primee1)ω(x) =n/primeω(x). Thus (144.12) is established.\n144C. L EMMA .Letω:P→P1be a mapping that satisﬁes (144.12). Then\nω(e) =e1and\n(144.13) ω(x+y) =ω(x) +ω(y)forall x,y ∈P\n(144.14) ω(xy) =ω(x)ω(y)forall x,y ∈P.\nProof . 1. We have 1 e= 1e. It follows from (144.12) that e1= 1e1= 1ω(e) =ω(e).\nLetx,y∈Pandm,n∈N×be given. Assume ﬁrst that me1< nω (x+y). It\nfollows from (144.12) that me<n (x+y). Ifme<nx , we seta:=m, b := 0, c:= 1.\nIfnx≤me<ny , we seta:= 0, b:=m, c := 1. Ifme≥nxandme≥ny, we have,\nby (142.6), me−ny <nx ≤me. SinceFis archimedean, Proposition 142J permits\nus to choose p,q∈N×such thatq(me−ny)<pe<qnx ≤qme (the last inequality\nby (142.16)); therefore p≤qm, by (142.17), and we set a:=p, b:=qm−p, c:=q.\nIn all three cases, c∈N×, andae≤cnx, be ≤cny, anda+b=cm. Then (144.12)\nyieldsae1≤cnω(x),be1≤cnω(y) (even when a= 0 orb= 0), and therefore, by\n(142.6),\ncme 1=ae1+be1≤cnω(x) +cnω(y) =cn(ω(x) +ω(y));\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 253\n144. Essential uniqueness of complete ordered ﬁelds 243\nconsequently, by (142.16), me1≤n(ω(x) +ω(y)).\nAssume next that me1>nω (x+y). It follows from (144.12) that me>n (x+y).\nThen 0 ≤ny < me andnx < me −ny≤me. By Proposition 142J we may choose\np,q∈N×such thatqnx<pe<q (me−ny)≤qme. Thenp≤qmandqnx<pe and\nqny< (qm−p)e. We infer from (144.12) that pe1≥qnω(x) and (qm−p)e1≥qnω(y),\nand therefore\nqme 1=pe1+ (qm−p)e1≥qnω(x) +qnω(y) =qn(ω(x+ω(y));\nconsequently, by (142.16), me1≥n(ω(x) +ω(y)).\nWe infer from the preceding two paragraphs that we have neither n(ω(x)+ω(y))<\nme1< nω (x+y) norn(ω(x) +ω(y))> me 1> nω (x+y). Sincem,n∈N×were\narbitrary and F1is archimedean, it follows from Proposition 142J that ω(x) +ω(y) =\nω(x+y). Sincex,y∈Pwere arbitrary, (144.13) is established.\n2. From (144.13) we have ω(0) =ω(0 + 0) =ω(0) +ω(0), and hence ω(0) =\nω(0)−ω(0) = 0. Therefore ω(0y) =ω(0) = 0 = 0 ω(y) =ω(0)ω(y) for ally∈P.\nLetx∈P×, y∈P, andm,n∈N×be given. Assume ﬁrst that me1< nω (xy).\nIt follows from (144.12) that me < nxy , and hence ( me)/x < ny . By Proposition\n142J we may choose p,q∈N×such that ( qme)/x=q((me)/x)< pe < qny . Then\nqme < px andpe < qny ; from (144.12) we infer that qme 1≤pω(x) andpe1≤\nqnω(y); by (142.8) it follows that pqme 1≤pqnω (x)ω(y) and hence, by (142.16),\nme1≤nω(x)ω(y). By exactly the same argument with the inequalities reversed\nit follows that me1> nω (xy) impliesme1≥nω(x)ω(y). We thus have neither\nnω(x)ω(y)<me 1<nω (xy) nornω(x)ω(y)>me 1>nω (xy). Sincem,n∈N×were\narbitrary and F1is archimedean, Proposition 142J yields that ω(xy) =ω(x)ω(y).\nSincex∈P×andy∈Pwere arbitrary, and since we have shown before that\nω(0y) =ω(0)ω(y) for ally∈P, (144.14) is established.\n144D. L EMMA .Letω:P→P1be a mapping that satisﬁes (144.13) and(144.14).\nDeﬁneψ:F→F1by the rule\n(144.15) ψ(x) :=\n\nω(x) ifx∈P\n−ω(−x)ifx∈F\\P=−P×.\nThen\n(144.16) ψ(−x) =−ψ(x)forall x∈F\n(144.17) ψ(x+y) =ψ(x) +ψ(y)forall x,y ∈F\n(144.18) ψ(xy) =ψ(x)ψ(y)forall x,y ∈F.\nProof . (144.16) is an immediate consequence of (144.15) and the fact tha tω(0) =\n0 (which follows from (144.13) as in the preceding proof). (144.18) f ollows from\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 254\n244 CHAPTER 14. THE REAL NUMBERS: COMPLETE ORDERED FIELDS\n(144.14), (144.15), (144.16): for example, if x∈P, y∈F\\P=−P×, we have\n−(xy) =x(−y)∈PP⊂P, andψ(xy) =−ω(−(xy)) =−ω(x(−y)) =−ω(x)ω(−y) =\nω(x)(−ω(−y)) =ψ(x)ψ(y).\nWe claim that\n(144.19) ∀x,y,z ∈F, x +y+z= 0⇒ψ(x) +ψ(y) +ψ(z) = 0 1.\nIn view of the symmetry of (144.19) and on account of (OF4), it is en ough to prove\n(144.19) under the additional restriction that x,y∈Porx,y∈ −P. The latter\ncase is reduced to the former by replacing x, y, z by−x,−y,−z, respectively, and\napplying (144.16). Now if x,y∈Pandx+y+z= 0, then −z=x+y∈P+P⊂P,\nand (144.15), (144.13), (144.16) yield\nψ(x) +ψ(y) +ψ(z) =ω(x) +ω(y)−ψ(−z) =ω(x+y)−ω(x+y) = 0 1,\nas claimed, thus establishing (144.19).\nFor allx,y∈Fwe havex+y+ (−(x+y)) = 0. It follows, using (144.16) and\n(144.19), that\nψ(x) +ψ(y)−ψ(x+y) =ψ(x) +ψ(y) +ψ(−(x+y)) = 0 1for allx,y∈F,\nand thus (144.17) is also established.\nProof of Theorem 144A . 1. Relying on Lemmas 144B, 144C, 144D with F:=F/prime\nandF1:=F/prime/prime, and again with F:=F/prime/primeandF1:=F/prime, we may choose mappings\nψ/prime/prime:F/prime→F/prime/primeandψ/prime/prime:F/prime/prime→F/primethat satisfy\n(144.20) ψ/prime(e/prime) =e/prime/primeψ/prime/prime(e/prime/prime) =e/prime\n(144.21) ψ/prime\n>(P/prime)⊂P/prime/primeψ/prime/prime\n>(P/prime/prime)⊂P/prime\n(144.22)ψ/prime(−x/prime) =−ψ/prime(x/prime) for allx/prime∈F/prime\nψ/prime/prime(−x/prime/prime) =−ψ/prime/prime(x/prime/prime) for allx/prime/prime∈F/prime/prime\n(144.23)ψ/prime(x/prime+y/prime) =ψ/prime(x/prime) +ψ/prime(y/prime) for allx/prime,y/prime∈F/prime\nψ/prime/prime(x/prime/prime+y/prime/prime) =ψ/prime/prime(x/prime/prime) +ψ/prime/prime(y/prime/prime) for allx/prime/prime,y/prime/prime∈F/prime/prime\n(144.24)ψ/prime(x/primey/prime) =ψ/prime(x/prime)ψ/prime(y/prime) for allx/prime,y/prime∈F/prime\nψ/prime/prime(x/prime/primey/prime/prime) =ψ/prime/prime(x/prime/prime)ψ/prime/prime(y/prime/prime) for allx/prime/prime,y/prime/prime∈F/prime/prime.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 255\n144. Essential uniqueness of complete ordered ﬁelds 245\nWe observe that φ/prime:=ψ/primeandφ/prime/prime:=ψ/prime/primesatisfy (144.1), (144.2), (144.3), (144.4),\n(144.5) (144.6), (144.7), (144.8) (from (144.7)), (144.9), and (1 44.10).\nFrom (144.23) we have\n(ψ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(x/prime+y/prime) =ψ/prime/prime(ψ/prime(x/prime+y/prime)) =ψ/prime/prime(ψ/prime(x/prime) +ψ/prime(y/prime)) =ψ/prime/prime(ψ/prime(x/prime)) +ψ/prime/prime(ψ/prime(y/prime)) =\n= (ψ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(x/prime) + (ψ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(y/prime) for allx/prime,y/prime∈F/prime;\nand from (144.24) a similar computation yields\n(ψ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(x/prime2) = ((ψ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(x/prime))2for allx/prime∈P/prime.\nFrom (144.20) we have ( ψ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(e/prime) =ψ/prime/prime(e/prime/prime) =e/prime/negationslash= 0/prime. Applying Corollary 143F to\nF:=F/primeandρ:=ψ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime, we conclude that ψ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime= 1F/prime.\nRepeating the argument with F/primeandF/prime/prime,ψ/primeandψ/prime/primeinterchanged, we conclude\nthatψ/prime◦ψ/prime/prime= 1F/prime/prime. Thusψ/primeandψ/prime/primeare invertible, and each is the inverse of the other.\nTherefore equality must hold in (144.21).\nBy (144.21), (144.22), (144.23), ψ/primeandψ/prime/primeare isotone, and therefore they are\norder-isomorphisms. Thus φ/prime:=ψ/primeandφ/prime/prime:=ψ/prime/primeare order-isomorphisms, each is the\ninverse of the other, and they satisfy (144.11).\n2. It remains to show that φ/prime:=ψ/primeandφ/prime/prime:=ψ/prime/primeare the only mappings satisfying\n(144.1), (144.2), (144.3) and (144.4), (144.5), (144.6).\nLetφ/prime/prime:F/prime/prime→F/primebe a mapping that satisﬁes (144.4), (144.5), (144.6). From\n(144.4) and (144.23), and from (144.5) and (144.24), we obtain, by computations\nsimilar to the preceding ones,\n(φ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(x/prime+y/prime) = (φ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(x/prime) + (φ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(y/prime) for allx/prime,y/prime∈F/prime\n(φ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(x/prime2) = ((φ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)(x/prime))2for allx/prime∈P/prime.\nBy (144.6) we have ( φ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime)◦ψ/prime/prime=φ/prime/prime◦(ψ/prime◦ψ/prime/prime) =φ/prime/prime◦1F/prime/prime=φ/prime/prime/negationslash= 0/prime\nF/prime/prime→F/prime, and\nthereforeφ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime/negationslash= 0/prime\nF/prime→F/prime. We may therefore apply Corollary 143F with F:=F/primeand\nρ:=φ/prime/prime◦ψ/primeand ﬁnd that φ/prime/prime◦ψ/prime= 1 F/prime. Thusφ/prime/primeis a left-inverse of the invertible\nmappingψ/prime, and therefore φ/prime/primemust beψ/prime/prime, the inverse of ψ/prime.\nIfφ/prime:F/prime→F/prime/primesatisﬁes (144.1), (144.2), (144.3), the same argument, with F/primeand\nF/prime/prime, ψ/primeandψ/prime/primeinterchanged, shows that φ/prime=ψ/prime.\n\nJuly 25, 2013 17:28 WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in icmp12-master\nThis page intentionally left blankThis page intentionally left blank\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 257\nChapter 15\nTHE REAL-NUMBER SYSTEM\n151. The Real-Number System\nThe real numbers, the operations with them, and the relations amo ng them consti-\ntute a fundamental cluster of notions in Mathematics. It is plain tha t some essential\nproperties of the system of real numbers are summarized by stat ing that it constitutes\nan ordered ﬁeld. Long before the concept was formalized, it was re alized that more\nwas required: a careful analysis of the use made of real numbers, such as originates\nwith the theory of ratios of Eudoxos, demands that this ordered ﬁ eld be complete .\nIt might seem that with this speciﬁcation we have not exhausted the demands\nimplicit in the structure of the system: we have not yet accounted, say, for notions of\ndistance, of nearness, of continuity, etc. Our “essential-unique ness result”, Theorem\n144A shows us, however, that such additional demands cannot re quire a choice among\ncomplete ordered ﬁelds, since these are all naturally isomorphic; th e additional no-\ntions will have to be accommodated by deriving them from the complet e-ordered-ﬁeld\nstructure itself.\nConcerning the question of existence of complete ordered ﬁelds, we refer to the\nintroductory comments in Section 141 and the discussion in Chapter 16. We shall\nlose no further sleep over this question here.\nWith the same turn of phrase used concerning the natural number s we say: We\nshall adopt, or pretend to adopt, the naive view that one speciﬁc c omplete ordered\nﬁeld is revealed to us, or singled out by us, as the Real-Number System , to be\ndenoted by R, and its members to be known as real numbers .\nWe should like to work in a mathematical world in which, justifying commo n\nusage, the natural numbers are themselves real numbers. We ac hieve this as follows.\nIn an ordered ﬁeld Fwith unity ethere is the counting system Ndescribed by\nTheorem 142E. We observe that neither the deﬁnition of complete o rdered ﬁeld, nor\nthe construction of Nwith its zero and successor-mapping, nor the proof of Theorem\n142E makes any appeal to the Natural-Number System. We also rec all that any\ncounting system could serve as the Natural-Number System. We th erefore take it for\ngranted that the counting system described by Theorem 142E for the specia l (complete)\nordered ﬁeld Ris in fact the Natural-Number System Nitself. This state of aﬀairs\n247\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 258\n248 CHAPTER 15. THE REAL-NUMBER SYSTEM\nmay be interpreted as part of the revelation, or the choice, that g ives us both systems;\nor it may, less satisfyingly, be regarded as a deliberate change in rec ognizing which\ncounting system is theNatural-Number System.\nWith this state of aﬀairs granted, the unity of Ris the natural number 1, and the\nnth multiple of this unity is the natural number nfor eachn∈N.\nOf course this state of aﬀairs would be anything but desirable if ther e were a clash\nbetween the operations and relations deﬁned for the natural num bers on the one hand,\nand the similarly designated operations and relations deﬁned for the real numbers, as\nadjusted to the subset of natural numbers, on the other. Prop osition 142F shows that\nthere is no such clash as regards order, zero, unity, addition, mult iplication, power\nformation (exponentiation), and subtraction (so far as meaningf ul inN). Proposition\n132D,(c) shows that, for n∈Nandr∈R, there is no clash between nr, the nth\nmultiple of the real number r, andnr, the product of the real numbers nandr.\nMost notation and terminology for Ris the same as that introduced for all (com-\nplete) ordered ﬁelds. We mention two items of specialized notation. T he positive half\nofRwill be denoted by P. Order-intervals in Rare written with ordinary (square)\nbrackets: for given a,b∈Rwitha≤bwe set\n[a,b] := [ [a,b] ] = {t∈R|a≤t≤b}\n[a,b[ := [ [a,b[ [ = {t∈R|a≤t<b}\n]a,b] := ] ]a,b] ] = {t∈R|a<t≤b}\n]a,b[ := ] ]a,b[ [ = {t∈R|a<t<b }.\nIn much mathematical writing one ﬁnds one of a pair of parentheses used instead of\nthe everted bracket: [ a,b),(a,b],(a,b) instead of [ a,b[,]a,b],]a,b[. This notation is\nless suggestive than the one we adhere to, and is actually confusing : (a,b) already\ndenotes a pair.\nEvery order-convex subset of Ris called an interval . This terminology involves\na mild clash with the term order-interval as introduced in Section 61, but is too\nentrenched (and useful) to be discarded. The clash will, moreover, be almost entirely\neliminated when all intervals will be shown, in the next section, to actu ally be order-\nintervals in the Extended-Real-Number System.\n151A. P ROPOSITION .A subset of Ris an interval if and only if it is an order-\ninterval of R, orRitself, or one of the sets a+P, a+P×, a−P, a−P×for some\na∈R.\nProof . This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 72J((i) ⇒(iv)) and the\ndeﬁnition of the order ≤inR.\nAn interval is said to be bounded if it is order-bounded; it follows from Propo-\nsition 151A that this is the case precisely when it is an order-interval. An interval is\nsaid to be genuine if it is neither empty nor a singleton.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 259\n151. The Real-Number System 249\n151B. P ROPOSITION .Every genuine interval is an uncountable set. In particular ,\nRis uncountable.\nProof . This is a reformulation of Proposition 143B. (See also Example 122H.)\nWe set Z:=N∪(−N). The members of Zare called integers (sometimes they are\ncalled whole numbers ). A real number is said to be integral if it is in Z. The natural\nnumbers are thus the positive integers. We show that Zis stable under addition,\nopposition, and multiplication; this will enable us to adjust these oper ations to Z.\n151C. P ROPOSITION .Z+Z=Z,−Z=Z,ZZ=Z.\nProof . We have N+N⊂N,NN⊂N, and 0,1∈N⊂Z. The assertion will\ntherefore be established once we prove that N−N⊂Z. Letm,n∈Nbe given. If\nm≥n, we havem−n∈N⊂Z; ifm<n , we havem−n=−(n−m)∈ −N⊂Z.\n151D. C OROLLARY .Zis a commutative ring with 0as zero, 1as unity, and\naddition, opposition, and multiplication adjusted from th e corresponding operations\ninR. This commutative ring is not a ﬁeld.\nProof . All but the last statement is obvious in view of Proposition 151C. For every\nn∈Z×we have |2n|= 2|n| ≥2·1 = 2>1, and therefore there is no n∈Zsuch that\n2n= 1.\nIt is convenient to extend to Zthe notation introduced by (92.9) for N:\nm..n :={k∈Z|m≤k≤n}for allm,n∈Z\n(see comments following (92.9) to explain this choice of notation).\nWe are now able to extend the notion of natural multiples (Section 11 5) in a\ncommutative group to that of integral multiples . Let the commutative group G,\nwritten additively, be given. We deﬁne\n(−n)x:=−nx=n(−x) for every x∈Gandn∈N×,\nthus completing the deﬁnition of nxfor alln∈Zandx∈G. The following result is\nobtained by straightforward veriﬁcation.\n151E. P ROPOSITION .The statements of Corollary 131D and Proposition 132 ,(c)\nremain valid when Nis replaced by Z.\nIn a commutative group Gwritten multiplicatively we have, correspondingly, the\nnotion of powersxnfor alln∈Zandx∈G, obtained by deﬁning\nx−n:=e/xn= (e/x)nfor everyx∈Gandn∈N×\n(whereeis the unity of G). This notation is applicable, in particular, to the multi-\nplicative group of a ﬁeld, and more in particular to the multiplicative gro upR×ofR.\nWe note that, by (142.4) and Proposition 142D,(b), we have\n(151.1) rn∈R×for alln∈Zandr∈R×.\nWe introduce two integer-valued mappings from RtoR.\nApril 17, 2014 11:57 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 260\n250 CHAPTER 15. THE REAL-NUMBER SYSTEM\n151F. P ROPOSITION .Letr∈Rbe given. The set Z∩(r+P) =Z∩Ub({r})has\na minimum and the set Z∩(r−P) =Z∩Lb({r})has a maximum.\nProof . Assume that r∈P. The set Z∩(r+P) =Z∩P∩(r+P) =N∩Ub({r}) is\na non-empty subset of N, since Ris archimedean; it therefore has a minimum.

The Extended-Real-Number System\nWe observed at the beginning of Section 143 that the complete orde red ﬁeld R\nhas no maximum; since opposition is an order-antimorphism from RtoR,Rhas no\nminimum either. It is sometimes convenient to regard the pre-comple tely ordered set\nRas an order-interval of a completely ordered set, as described in E xample 72I,(b),\nby relying on Theorem 72G. To that end we choose, or assume to be s peciﬁed, a\ndoubleton {∞,∞/prime}that is disjoint from R, and set ¯R:=R∪{∞,∞/prime}; we then deﬁne\nin¯Ra relation, again denoted by ≤, by requiring that its restriction to Rbe the order\nofRand that ∞/prime≤tandt≤ ∞ for allt∈¯R. Then ¯Ris totally and completely\nordered by ≤, and∞/prime= min ¯R= infRand∞= max ¯R= supR. The corresponding\nstrict-order is again denoted by <.\nIt is desirable to extend to ¯R, or as far as possible into ¯R, the algebraic op-\nerations in R, while preserving the validity of as many as possible of their basic\nproperties. Thus, we deﬁne the opposition (t/mapsto→ −t) :¯R→¯Rby requiring that\nit agree with opposition on Rand satisfy −∞ :=∞/prime,−∞/prime:=∞. From now on\nwe shall always write −∞ for∞/prime. We deﬁne the addition ((s,t)/mapsto→s+t) :\n(¯R×¯R)\\{(∞,−∞),(−∞,∞)} → ¯Rby requiring that it agree with addition on\nR×Rand satisfy\n∞+t:=t+∞:=∞ for allt∈R∪ {∞}\n−∞+t:=t+ (−∞) :=−∞ for allt∈R∪ {−∞} ;\nthesubtraction ((s,t)/mapsto→s−t) : (¯R×¯R)\\{(∞,∞),(−∞,−∞)} → ¯Rby the rule\ns−t:=s+ (−t) for all (s,t) in the domain; and the multiplication ((s,t)/mapsto→st) :\n¯R×¯R→¯Rby requiring that it agree with multiplication on R×Rand satisfy\n∞ ·t:=t· ∞:=\n\n∞ ift>0\n0 ift= 0 for all t∈¯R\n−∞ ift<0\n(−∞)·t:=t·(−∞) :=\n\n−∞ ift>0\n0 ift= 0 for all t∈¯R.\n∞ ift<0\nIt must be noted that many results (e.g., concerning limits) that invo lve multipli-\ncation in ¯Rare valid only if the domain of multiplication is restricted to exclude\nmultiplication of 0 by either ∞or−∞.\nIt may be seen that the associative, commutative, and neutrality la ws for both ad-\ndition and multiplication, as well as the distributive law, are preserved ; but note that\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 263\n152.

The for-\nmulas (131.1), (131.2), (131.3), (131.4), (131.5), (132.1), (132.2 ), (132.3) also remain\nvalid in ¯R. The cancellation laws fail. The strict monotonicity laws in Proposition\n142C and Corollary 142G,(b) fail, but their lax analogues remain valid. N otations\nsuch asA×, A+B, A−B, AB for subsets A, B of¯Rare deﬁned as in Sections 131\nand 132, so long as the deﬁnition remains meaningful.\nThe completely ordered set ¯R, thus endowed with structure, is called the\nExtended-Real-Number System ; its members are called extended-real num-\nbers ;∞is called ( plus)inﬁnity , and is regarded as strictly positive; −∞ is called\nminus inﬁnity , and is regarded as strictly negative. An extended-real number is\nsaid to be ﬁnite orinﬁnite according as it is in Ror not.\nWe set ¯P:=P∪ {∞} ={t∈¯R|t≥0}, and extend the use of plain square\nbrackets for order-intervals in Rto those in ¯R.

By Theorem 122A\n]0,1] is uncountable (the idea for this proof of the uncountability of ]0 ,1] goes back to\nGeorg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (1845-1918)). It is easy to d educe that every\ngenuine interval is uncountable. Although this was already establish ed in Proposi-\ntion 151B (also due to Cantor, as noted in Example 122H), the prese nt observation\nprovides a more precise determination of the “degree of uncounta bility” of genuine\nintervals: every one is equinumerous with the uncountable set P(N).\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 271\nChapter 16\nTHE REAL NUMBERS:\nEXISTENCE\n161. Construction of a complete ordered\nﬁeld\nAs was explained in Sections 141 and 151, we are concerned with the q uestion\nregarding the existence of a complete ordered ﬁeld only to the exte nt of ascertaining\nthat this question is equivalent to the one regarding the existence o f a counting\nsystem. Cultural Anthropology and the history of Mathematics will surely bear\nout the contention that it is more natural to accept consciously th e existence of\nthe Natural-Number System — no matter how much sophistication th is may have\nrequired — than to extend the same degree of acceptance to the e xistence of the entire\nReal-Number System. It has therefore long been regarded as a ma tter of interest to\nshow, by means of a construction, that the acceptance of the fo rmer compels the\nacceptance of the latter.\nInstead of carrying out this program by ﬁrst constructing, from a given counting\nsystem, structures imitating (technically: isomorphic to) ZandQ, we prefer to use\nas our intermediate step a structure imitating ¯P(cf. Section 152), and to obtain this\nstructure from a counting system by a version of the Eudoxian the ory of ratios.\nWe deﬁne a positivity system to be a completely and totally ordered set P\n(with strict-order and lax order here denoted by <and≤, respectively, and with\n∞:= maxP), endowed, in addition, with the structures of a commutative mono id,\nwritten additively, and of a commutative monoid, written multiplicative ly (with unity\ne), subject to the following conditions:\n(PS1): ∀x,y,z ∈P, (x+y)z= (xz) + (yz)\n(PS2): ∀x,y∈P,x+y=x⇒(x=∞or y = 0)\n(PS3): ∀x,y∈P,x+y=∞ ⇒ (x=∞or y =∞)\n(PS4): ∀x,y∈P,x≤y⇔(∃z∈P, x +z=y)\n(PS5):e /∈ {0,∞}\n(PS6): ∀x∈P,x /∈ {0,∞} ⇒ (∃y∈P, xy =e}.\n261\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 272\n262 CHAPTER 16.

Since x≤x, we may, by (PS4), choose y∈Psuch thatx+y=x. From (PS2)\nit follows that y= 0. On the other hand, by (PS4), ∞ ≤ ∞ + 0≤maxP=∞, so\nthat equality holds.\n(b): From (PS4) we ﬁnd min P≤0≤0+minP= minP; it follows that min P= 0,\nand from this and (PS5) we have 0 <e< ∞.\n161B.

(161.1) is an immediate consequence of (PS3).\nFor everyx∈Pwe have, by (PS4), ∞ ≤ ∞ +x=x+∞ ≤ ∞ ; hence\n(161.6) ∀x∈P, x +∞=∞.\nFrom (PS4) and (161.6) we have\n(161.7) ∞=e∞ ≤e∞+∞∞ = (e+∞)∞=∞∞ ≤ ∞.\nLetx∈P×\n0be given.

Then x+x0 =xe+x0 =x(e+ 0) =xe=x, and therefore,\nby (PS2),x0 = 0. This establishes (161.3). We have 0 ∞= (0 + 0) ∞= 0∞+ 0∞.

Construction of a complete ordered ﬁeld 263\nLetx,y∈P×\n0be given. By (PS6), we may choose u,v∈Psuch thatxu=e=yv.\nThen (PS5) yields\n(xy)(uv) = (xu)(yv) =ee=e∈P×\n0.\nFrom this and (161.3), (161.8), (161.9) it follows that xy∈P×\n0. This establishes\n(161.4), and (161.2) follows from this and (161.3).\nIfx∈P×\n0,y∈P, andxy=e, then (161.3) and (161.8) show that y∈P×\n0. This,\ntogether with (PS6), establishes (161.5).\nLet the positivity system Pbe given. For given x,y∈Pwe consider the problem\n(161.10) ? z∈P, x +z=y.\nBy (PS4), this problem has a solution if and only if x≤y. Now suppose that\nx≤y<∞. Ifz/prime,z/prime/primeare solutions of (161.10) with z/prime≤z/prime/prime, we may, by (PS4), choose\nu∈Psuch thatz/prime+u=z/prime/prime. Theny=x+z/prime/prime=x+z/prime+u=y+u. By (PS2) we ﬁnd\nthatu= 0, and hence z/prime/prime=z/prime+ 0 =z/prime. SincePis totally ordered, this discussion\nshows that, if x≤y <∞, then (161.10) has exactly one solution; by (PS4), this\nsolution is in P0. In that case we deﬁne\ny−x:∈ {z∈P|x+z=y} ⊂P0.\nWe note that\n∀x,y∈P0, x ≤y⇒(y−x= 0⇔x=y).\nWe set\n(161.11) F:={(x,y)∈P0×P0|xy= 0},\nand deﬁne the mapping p:P0×P0→P0×P0by the rule\n(161.12)p((x,y)) := (x−min{x,y}, y−min{x,y}) for all ( x,y)∈P0×P0.\nIn the following two lemmas Pis a given positivity system, and Fandpare deﬁned\nby (161.11) and (161.12).\n161C.

Then x−min{x,y}= 0 ory−\nmin{x,y}= 0 according as x≤yorx≥y; it follows from (161.3) that p((x,y))∈F.\nWe conclude that Rng p⊂F.\nOn the other hand, let ( x,y)∈Fbe given. By (161.4) either x= 0 ory= 0, and\nhence min {x,y}= 0, since 0 = min P(Remark 161A,(b)). It follows that p((x,y)) =\n(x,y). ThusF⊂Rngp, and every member of Fis a ﬁxed point of p.

Then X={(1,1)}X⊂(L({1,1)}))X. On the other\nhand, if (m,m/prime)∈L({1,1)}),(x,x/prime)∈X, thenm≤m/prime, and hence mxx/prime≤m/primexx/prime,\nso that (m,m/prime)(x,x/prime) = (mx,m/primex/prime)≼(x,x/prime). Therefore ( m,m/prime)(x,x/prime)∈L(U(X)) =\nX. We have shown that L({(1,1)})X⊂X. We conclude that L({(1,1)})X=X.\nThis establishes the neutrality law for multiplication. By Remark 161A,( a), it is not\nnecessary to prove the neutrality law for addition explicitly.\n3. LetX,Y∈RngLbe given, and assume that X/negationslash= Λ andY/negationslash=L(Λ). Then we\nmay choose η∈Y\\L(Λ) and, by Lemma 161C, k∈N×such that (k−1,1)η∈Xand\n(k,1)η /∈X. Since (k−1,1)η+η≈(k,1)η, we ﬁnd(k−1,1)η+η∈(X+Y)\\X⊂\n(X⊕Y)\\X, so thatX⊕Y/negationslash=X. This shows that (PS2) holds.\nLetX,Y∈RngL\\{Λ}be given. We may choose µ∈Λ\\X=U(X)\\Xand\nν∈Λ\\Y=U(Y)\\Y. Thenµ+ν∈U(X+Y) =U(X⊕Y). Therefore U(X⊕Y)/negationslash=\nØ =U(Λ), and hence X⊕Y/negationslash= Λ. This shows that (PS3) holds.\nLetX,Y∈RngLbe given. If Y=X⊕Zfor someZ∈RngL, thenX⊂X+Z⊂\nX⊕Z=Y(sinceZ/negationslash= Ø). Conversely, assume that X⊂Y, note that ξ≼µfor all\nξ∈Xandµ∈U(Y), and deﬁne\nZ:=L(U(Y)−X)∈RngL.\nFor allξ∈X, ζ ∈Z, andµ∈U(Y) we haveζ≼µ−ξ, and hence ξ+ζ≼µ.\nThereforeU(Y)⊂U(X+Z), and hence\n(162.6) X⊕Z=L(U(X+Z))⊂L(U(Y)) =Y.\nOn the other hand, let µ∈Λ\\U(Y) be given. We may then choose η∈Ysuch\nthatµ≺η. Setδ:= (1,2)(η−µ), and note that (0 ,1)≺δ, so thatδ∈Λ\\L(Λ). We\nnow distinguish two cases. If µ+δ∈X, thenµ+δ∈X+Z; butµ≺µ+δ, and so\nµ∈Λ\\U(X+Z). We are left with the case in which µ+δ∈Λ\\X=U(X)\\X, and in\nthis caseX/negationslash= Λ. By Lemma 162C we may choose k∈N×such that (k−1,1)δ∈X\nand (k,1)δ /∈X. Sinceµ+δ∈U(X), we may set ζ:= (µ+δ)−(k−1,1)δand ﬁnd,\nusing the deﬁnition of δ, thatζ≈η−(k,1)δ.\nFor allξ∈Xandλ∈U(Y) we haveξ≺(k,1)δandη≼λ, so thatξ+η≺\nλ+ (k,1)δ, and therefore ζ≈η−(k,1)δ≺λ−ξ. It follows that ζ∈Z, and therefore\nµ≺µ+δ≈ζ+ (k−1,1)δ∈X+Z. We conclude that µ∈Λ\\U(X+Z) in this case\ntoo.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 280\n270 CHAPTER 16.

This completes the proof of the\nvalidity of (PS4).\n4. It is obvious that L(Λ) = {0} ×N×/subsetornotdbleqlL({(1,1)})/subsetornotdbleqlΛ, so that (PS5) holds.\nLetX∈RngL\\{Λ,L(Λ)}be given, and set\nY:=L({(c,c/prime)∈Λ|c/negationslash= 0,(c/prime,c)∈X})∈RngL.\nLet (x,x/prime)∈Xand (y,y/prime)∈Ybe given. Then either x= 0, and in that case\n(x,x/prime)(y,y/prime) = (0,x/primey/prime)∈L({(1,1)}); or elsex/negationslash= 0, and then ( y,y/prime)≼(x/prime,x), so\nthat (x,x/prime)(y,y/prime)≼(1,1) and therefore ( x,x/prime)(y,y/prime)∈L({(1,1)}). We conclude that\nXY⊂L({(1,1)}), and therefore\n(162.7)X⊙Y=L(U(XY))⊂L(U(L({(1,1)}))) =L({1,1)}).\nOn the other hand, let ( a,a/prime)∈Λ\\U(L({(1,1)})) be given, so that a<a/prime. Since\nX/negationslash=L(Λ), we may choose ( m,m/prime)∈X\\L(Λ), so that m/negationslash= 0. Since X/negationslash= Λ, we may\nchoose, by Lemma 162C, k∈N×such that\n((k−1)m,a/primem/prime) = (k−1,1)(m,a/primem/prime)∈X,\n(km,a/primem/prime) = (k,1)(m,a/primem/prime)∈Λ\\X=U(X)\\X.\nWe have (m,m/prime)≺(km,a/primem/prime), so thatk >a/prime, and therefore k(a/prime−a)≥k >a/prime, and\nhence\n(162.8) ka< (k−1)a/prime.\nFor all (x,x/prime)∈Xwithx/negationslash= 0 we have ( x,x/prime)≺(km,a/primem/prime), and hence ( a/primem/prime,km)≺\n(x/prime,x). It follows that ( a/primem/prime,km)∈Y. From this and (162.8) we ﬁnd\n(a,a/prime)≺(k−1,k)≈((k−1)m,a/primem/prime)(a/primem/prime,km)∈XY.\nTherefore ( a,a/prime)∈Λ\\U(XY).

Introduction\nIn all mathematical work, with insigniﬁcant exceptions, we must dea l with a\nprofusion of inﬁnite sets. Our intuition is, however, not too well equ ipped for all\naspects of this task, and on occasion fails us altogether. The most basic agreements\nabout sets, mappings, and relations that we have accepted and us ed are not quite\npowerful enough to settle some rather natural questions conce rning inﬁnite sets. To\novercome some of these diﬃculties, several assertions have been proposed and used\nas additional agreements or “axioms”: an example is the Axiom of Cho ice, which we\nhave already encountered. Their acceptability has had its ups and d owns since they\nwere ﬁrst made explicit, beginning at the turn of the 20th century. Later, they were\nshown to be compatible with the more basic agreements about sets a nd mappings\n(i.e., their acceptance would not ruin the consistency of these agre ements, if they are\nconsistent). Finally, it was shown that they are independent of the se agreements (i.e.,\ntheir rejection would not ruin such consistency either; in particular , they could not\nbe proved from more basic principles by accepted rules of inference ).\nIn this chapter we shall introduce the most useful of these asser tions. Some have\nstrong intuitive appeal, as, e.g., some forms of the Axiom of Choice. O thers seem far\nless credible: a good example is the assertion that every set can be w ell-ordered (we\ncannot eﬀectively well-order even the set R). Nevertheless, all the assertions that we\npresent are in fact equivalent: this means that any one of them can be proved, by\naccepted rules of inference, on the assumption of any other, tog ether with the more\nbasic agreements about sets and mappings.\nWhat attitude is one to adopt with regard to the validity of such “mar ginal”\nassertions? This depends, of course, on the purpose at hand. Fo r general mathematics\nas practiced by the ordinary mathematician, as well as for the educ ated user of\nmathematics, the prevailing, and probably most advisable, course is this: to accept\nthe validity of these assertions freely, but to make unobtrusive me ntion of their use\nwhen engaged in careful exposition; and to avoid their use, as a mat ter of good style,\nwhen it is not excessively costly to do so.\n273\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 284\n274 CHAPTER 17. INFINITE SETS\nSince the purpose of this chapter is, to a large extent, to acquaint the readers with\nthese assertions and, secondarily, to convince them of their equiv alence, we do not,\nin this chapter, commit ourselves to the acceptance of any one of t hese assertions.\nInstead, we show the derivation of all from a single one, Hausdorﬀ’s Maximality\nPrinciple, chosen for its simplicity and plausibility.\nIn broad outline this account follows J. L. Kelley, General Topology (Van Nos-\ntrand). The quite complicated argument required to complete the p roof of the equiv-\nalence (Lemmas 177A, 177B) is included only for the record; it is esse ntially due to\nErnst Zermelo (1871-1953), and our account follows P.R. Halmos, Naive Set Theory\n(Van Nostrand).\nA word about terminology. The labels “Principle”, “Lemma”, and “Axio m” signal\nno diﬀerence in status; they should be regarded as quaint and color ful relics of a\ndebate to decide which of these assertions was more “fundamenta l” than the rest.\nThe attributions by name to individual mathematicians are loosely tra ditional, and\nare in some cases more grounded in habit than in history. The assert ions to be\nintroduced will be identiﬁed by Roman numerals.\nIt is not our aim, in this chapter, to develop the theory of inﬁnite set s much\nbeyond the purpose already stated. However, in Section 175 we dis cuss the most\nelementary facts concerning the comparison of sets by “size”, an d in Section 176 we\ndo something similar for well-ordered sets. These facts serve as po ints of departure\nfor so-called transﬁnite cardinal and ordinal arithmetic, respect ively; but we do not\npursue these topics in the present account.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 285\n172. Maximality principles 275\n172. Maximality principles\nEach of the assertions discussed in this section states that some o rdered set has a\nmaximal member.\nWe recall from Section 61 that a collection of sets is called a nest if it is totally\nordered by inclusion; and that an ordered subset Sof an ordered set Dis called\nachain ofDifSis totally ordered. In particular, if Dis a collection of sets, a\nsubcollection SofDis a chain of Dordered by inclusion if and only if Sis a nest.\n(I) (H AUSDORFF’S MAXIMALITY PRINCIPLE ).In every collection of sets there is a\nmaximal nest; more precisely, if Dis a collection of sets, then the collection {N ∈\nP(D)| N is a nest }, ordered by inclusion, has a maximal member.\n(II)[(III)] (S ETMAXIMALITY PRINCIPLE ).IfDis a [non-empty] collection of sets\nsuch that every [non-empty] nest N ∈P(D)satisﬁes/uniondisplay\nN ∈ D , then Dordered by\ninclusion has a maximal member.\n(IV) (K URATOWSKI’S LEMMA ).IfDis an ordered set, every chain of Dis included\nin a maximal chain of D, i.e., in a maximal member of the collection of all chains of\nD, ordered by inclusion.\n(V) (Z ORN’S LEMMA ).IfDis an ordered set such that every chain of Dhas an\nupper bound, then Dhas a maximal member.\n172A. L EMMA .LetDbe an ordered set and Ma maximal chain of D. Then\nevery upper bound of Mis a maximal member of D.\nProof . Letm∈Ub(M) be given, and let x∈Dbe given such that m≺x. Then\nx∈Ub(M), so thatM∪ {x}is a chain of D. In view of the maximality of M, we\nmust haveM∪ {x}=M, which implies x∈M, and therefore x≺m. We conclude\nthatx=m.\n172B. L EMMA .LetDbe an ordered set, and let the chain CofDand the nest\nNof subsets of Dbe given. If C∪Sis a chain of Dfor everyS∈ N, thenC∪/uniondisplay\nN\nis a chain of D.\nProof . IfN= Ø, thenC∪/uniondisplay\nN=C, and the assertion follows trivially. Assume\nnow that N /negationslash= Ø. Letx,y∈C∪/uniondisplay\nNbe given. We may choose S,T∈ N such that\nx∈C∪Sandy∈C∪T. Since Nis a nest, we have S∪T∈ N, andC∪(S∪T)\nis a chain of D. Since this chain contains xandy, we conclude that x≺yory≺x.\nSincex,y∈C∪/uniondisplay\nNwere arbitrary, we conclude that C∪/uniondisplay\nNis a chain of D.\n172C.

In particular, this holds for every non-empty nest, and in addition\nØ =/uniondisplay\nØ∈ D, so that Dis not empty. If (III) holds, then Dordered by inclusion\nhas a maximal member.\n(II)implies (IV). LetDbe an ordered set, and let the chain CofDbe given. Set\nD:={S∈P(D)|C∪Sis a chain of D}. By Lemma 172B, every nest N ∈P(D)\nsatisﬁes/uniondisplay\nN ∈ D .\nAssume now that (II) holds. We may then choose a maximal member MofD\nordered by inclusion. Since obviously C∪M∈ D, we haveC⊂M. We claim that M\nis a maximal member of the collection of allchains ofD, ordered by inclusion. Indeed,\nifNis a chain of D, such that M⊂N, we haveC⊂M⊂N; henceC∪N=Nis a\nchain ofD, so thatN∈ D. ButMis a maximal member of D, and hence M=N.\nThusMis a maximal chain of D, as claimed.\n(IV) implies (V). LetDbe an ordered set such that every chain of Dhas an upper\nbound. If (IV) holds, we may choose a maximal chain of D(by taking the given chain\nto be Ø); this maximal chain of Dhas an upper bound; and by Lemma 172A such\nan upper bound is a maximal member of D.\n(IV) implies (I). Apply (IV) to the case in which Dis the collection of sets D,\nordered by inclusion, and the given chain of Dis the nest Ø.\n(V)implies (II). Apply (V) to the case in which Dis the collection of sets D,\nordered by inclusion, and every nest N ∈P(D) has its union as an upper bound in\nD.\n172D. R EMARK . Every non-empty ﬁnite ordered set has a maximal member, and\nevery collection of subsets of a ﬁnite set is ﬁnite (Proposition 105A — applied to the\nreverse order — and Corollaries 103J and 101F). Therefore the sp ecial cases of (I),\n(II), and (III) in which Disﬁnite and those of (IV) and (V) in which Disﬁnite , are\nvalid regardless of the status of the assertions (I), (II), (III) , (IV), (V) themselves.\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 287\n173.

Comparison of sets 283\n175. Comparison of sets\nWe recall that sets SandTare said to be equinumerous if there exists a bijection\nfromStoTor, equivalently, a bijection from TtoS. For ﬁnite sets, this word is well\nchosen, since ﬁnite sets are equinumerous if and only if they have th e same cardinal\nnumber (Corollary 101D). If SandTare ﬁnite sets, then # S≤#Tif and only if\nthere exists an injection from StoT(Proposition 101E). We use this observation\nto motivate the following terminology. Let the sets SandTbe given. Then Sis\nsaid to be outnumbered by T, andTis said to outnumber S, if there exists an\ninjection from StoT. It is clear that if S, T, U are sets and Uoutnumbers TandT\noutnumbers S, thenUoutnumbers S. IfToutnumbers SbutSdoes not outnumber\nT, thenSis said to be strictly outnumbered by T, andTis said to strictly\noutnumber S.\nIf the sets SandTare equinumerous, it is obvious that Toutnumbers Sand\nSoutnumbers T. It is reasonable to ask whether the reverse implication holds. It\nis also reasonable to ask whether, for a given pair of sets, one set in the pair must\noutnumber the other. The answer to the former question is aﬃrma tive, as we shall\npresently recall. An aﬃrmative answer to the latter question, howe ver, is an assertion\nthat will eventually be seen to be equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.\n175A. T HEOREM . (SCHR ¨ODER -BERNSTEIN THEOREM ).Let the sets SandTbe given.\nThenSandTare equinumerous if (and only if) Toutnumbers SandSoutnumbers\nT.\nProof . This is a restatement of Theorem 75C.\n175B. P ROPOSITION .Every set is strictly outnumbered by its power set.\nProof . Let the set Sbe given. The mapping ( s/mapsto→ {s}) :S→P(S) is obviously\ninjective. If there existed an injection from P(S) toS, we could choose one, say f.\nSinceP(S)/negationslash= Ø, we could choose a left-inverse of f, and this left-inverse would be a\nsurjection from StoP(S). But there is no surjection from StoP(S), as was shown\nin Proposition 32E.\nWe formulate the following assertions.\n(XIV) (P RINCIPLE OFCOMPARABILITY ).IfSandTare sets, then either Toutnum-\nbersSorSoutnumbers T.\n(XV) (P RINCIPLE OFCOMPARABILITY FORSURJECTIONS ).IfSandTare non-empty\nsets, then there exists either a surjection from StoTor a surjection from TtoS.\n175C. P ROPOSITION . (VII) implies (XIV) and(XIV) implies (XV).\nProof . (VII) implies (XIV). Assume that (VII) holds. Let the sets SandTbe\ngiven, and consider the collection\nG:={G∈P(S×T)| ∀(x,y),(x/prime,y/prime)∈G, x =x/prime⇔y=y/prime}.\nIt is plain that Gis a collection of binary character. By (VII) we may therefore choo se\na maximal member MofG.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 294\n284 CHAPTER 17. INFINITE SETS\nWe claim that\n(175.1)for every (x,y)∈S×Tthere exists ( x/prime,y/prime)∈S×Tsuch that\n(x,y/prime)∈Mor (x/prime,y)∈M.\nIndeed, suppose that ( u,v)∈S×Twere such that ( u,y/prime)/∈Mand (x/prime,v)/∈Mfor\nall (x/prime,y/prime)∈S×T. Then we should ﬁnd that ( u,v)/∈Mand thatM∪ {(u,v)} ∈ G ,\ncontradicting the maximality of M. This establishes the claimed validity of (175.1).\nIt follows from (175.1) that either\n(175.2) for every x∈Sthere is at least one y∈Tsuch that (x,y)∈M\nor\n(175.3) for every y∈Tthere is at least one x∈Ssuch that (x,y)∈M.\nMoreover, since M∈ G, we also have, in every case,\n(175.4)for everyx∈Sthere is at most one y∈Tsuch that (x,y)∈M,and\nfor everyy∈Tthere is at most one x∈Ssuch that (x,y)∈M.\nIf (175.2) holds, then (175.2) and (175.4) show that Mis the graph of an injection\nfromStoT. If, on the other hand, (175.3) holds, then (175.3) and (175.4) sh ow that\n{(y,x)∈T×S|(x,y)∈M}is the graph of an injection from TtoS. Hence either\nToutnumbers SorSoutnumbers T.\n(XIV) implies (XV). Every injection with non-empty domain is left-invertible, and\neach left-inverse is surjective. The desired implication is an immediate consequence\nof this observation.\n175D. R EMARKS . (a): Theorem 175A makes it appear desirable to assign to\nevery setS, whether ﬁnite or inﬁnite, an object # S, the cardinal of S, in such a way\nthat the following condition is satisﬁed: If SandTare sets, then # S= #Tif and\nonly ifSandTare equinumerous. The objects that occur as cardinals of sets wo uld\nbe the cardinal numbers ; and we could deﬁne a “relation” ≤among cardinal numbers\nby requiring # S≤#Tif and only if Toutnumbers S. This “relation” is obviously\nreﬂexive and transitive, and Theorem 175A shows that it is also antis ymmetric. It\nis therefore an “order”. Assertion (XIV) is then equivalent to the assertion that this\n“order” is total; (XIV) is therefore also known as the Law of Trichotomy (because it\nasserts that either # S < #Tor #S= #Tor #T < #S, but no two at the same\ntime, for any sets S, T ; here<is the “strict-order” corresponding to ≤).\nThe question that must be answered to make this idea eﬀective is, Wh at objects\nare the cardinal numbers to be? We shall not explore this matter an y further, but\nwe mention that a satisfactory answer can indeed be given, and tha t one can arrange\nto have the natural numbers as the “ﬁnite” cardinal numbers, i.e., the cardinals of\nﬁnite sets. The cardinal numbers, both ﬁnite and inﬁnite (or “tran sﬁnite”, as they\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 295\n175. Comparison of sets 285\nare sometimes called), constitute the subject matter of a branch of set theory called\ncardinal arithmetic. They can be added and multiplied and raised to po wers in such\na way that all the results proved in Section 103 remain valid with the as sumption of\nﬁniteness deleted. A glimpse of some perhaps unexpected facts of cardinal arithmetic\ncan be obtained from results such as Corollary 175F.\nProposition 175B shows that there is no “greatest” cardinal numb er, since #S <\n#P(S) for every set S. This suggests that there are “many” cardinal numbers.\nThere are indeed so “many” that it is not proper to speak of “the se t of all cardinal\nnumbers”, just as it is not proper to speak of “the set of all sets” . That is why the\nwords “relation”, “order”, “strict-order”, and “greatest” ab ove were put in quotation\nmarks; for every setof cardinal numbers, however, the “restriction” of ≤to that set\nisan order, and this order is total if (XIV) holds.\n(b): If the Axiom of Countable Choice holds (it is a consequence of (X ), and hence\nof (VII) by Proposition 174B), then every inﬁnite set outnumbers every countable set\n(Corollary 121W). Consequently, # Nis the least inﬁnite cardinal number; it is often\ndenoted by ℵ0.\nThe rest of this section contains some useful additional results co ncerning the size\nof inﬁnite sets. They all depend on assertion (VII) or (III), as ind icated in each case.\n175E. T HEOREM .If(VII) holds, then every inﬁnite set has a partition whose\nmembers are countably inﬁnite sets.\nProof . Let the inﬁnite set Sbe given, and consider the collection ∆ of all disjoint\ncollections of countably inﬁnite subsets of S. It is obvious that ∆ is a collection of\nbinary character. By (VII) we may therefore choose a maximal me mberMof ∆;\nthusMis a maximal disjoint collection of countably inﬁnite subsets of S.\nBy (VII) and Proposition 174B, the Axiom of Choice (X) holds, and co nsequently\nwe may apply Theorem 121V. If S\\(/uniondisplay\nM) were inﬁnite, that theorem shows that we\nmight choose a countably inﬁnite subset NofS\\(/uniondisplay\nM); but then M∪{N} ∈∆, and\nthis would contradict the maximality of M. We conclude that S\\(/uniondisplay\nM) is ﬁnite.\nIfMwere empty, we should ﬁnd that S=S\\(/uniondisplay\nM) is ﬁnite, contrary to the\nassumption. Therefore Mis not empty, and we may choose M∈ M . NowK:=\nS\\(/uniondisplay\n(M\\{M})) = (S\\(/uniondisplay\nM))∪M, and this union of a ﬁnite set and a countably\ninﬁnite set is countably inﬁnite (this follows from Corollary 121O, but c an easily\nbe shown directly from the deﬁnitions). We conclude that ( M\\{M})∪ {K}is the\ndesired partition of Sinto countably inﬁnite subsets.\n175F. C OROLLARY .If(VII) holds, and if Sis an inﬁnite set and Ta countable\nnon-empty set, then the sets S, S×T, andT×Sare equinumerous.\nProof . By Theorem 175E we may choose a partition PofSwhose members are\ncountably inﬁnite sets. By Corollary 121F, each member of Pis equinumerous with\nN.

We conclude that\n(175.5) SandP ×Nare equinumerous;\nit follows that\n(175.6) S×Tand (P ×N)×Tare equinumerous .\nNowN×Tis inﬁnite (since T/negationslash= Ø) and is outnumbered by N×N(sinceTis\ncountable); but N×Nis countable, and hence so is N×T(Corollary 121L and\nProposition 121B). Thus N×Tis countably inﬁnite, and hence equinumerous to N\n(Corollary 121F). Hence\n(175.7) P ×NandP ×(N×T) are equinumerous .\nSince ( P ×N)×TandP × (N×T) are obviously equinumerous, it follows from\n(175.5), (175.7), and (175.6) that SandS×Tare equinumerous. On the other hand,\nS×TandT×Sare of course equinumerous.\n175G. L EMMA .Assume that (VII) holds and let the sets KandLbe given.

It is clear that/uniondisplay\nNis the graph of a bijection from M:= (π1)>(/uniondisplay\nN) toM:= (π2)>(/uniondisplay\nN) (cf.\nTheorem 43D). The proof of (175.10) will be complete when we show t hat\n(175.11) M=F(M).\nUsing (175.8), we ﬁnd\n(175.12) M= (π1)>(/uniondisplay\nN) =/uniondisplay\n((π1)>)>(N)\n(175.13)M= (π2)>(/uniondisplay\nN) =/uniondisplay\n((π2)>)>(N) =/uniondisplay\n{F((π1)>)(G))|G∈ N} ⊂\n⊂F(/uniondisplay\n((π1)>)>(N)) =F(M).\nConversely, let F∈F(M) be given. By (175.12) and the Principle of Finite Choice\n(Theorem 103L), we may choose a non-empty ﬁnite subcollection FofNsuch that\nF∈/uniondisplay\n((π1)>)>(F). Since Fis a non-empty ﬁnite nest, we have/uniondisplay\nF ∈ F ⊂ G\n(Corollary 105C), and F⊂(π1)>(/uniondisplay\nF). Therefore, by (175.8),\nF∈F((π1)>(/uniondisplay\nF)) = (π2)>(/uniondisplay\nF)⊂(π2)>(/uniondisplay\nN) =M.\nSinceF∈F(M) was arbitrary, we conclude that F(M)⊂ M . Together with (175.13)\nthis establishes (175.11).\nThis completes the proof of the assertion that Gordered by inclusion has a max-\nimal member.\n3. Choose a maximal member HofG, and setM: (π1)>(H), so that, by (175.8),\nF(M) = (π2)>(H). By the deﬁnition of G, we note that Mis inﬁnite. Our aim in\nthis part of the proof is to show that Moutnumbers S\\M.\nSuppose not; then S\\Moutnumbers M, by (XIV), and we may choose a subset\nPofS\\Msuch thatMandPare equinumerous. It follows from Corollary 175I\nthatMandM∪Pare equinumerous, and therefore F(M),F(P), and F(M∪P) are\nequinumerous. Now Pis inﬁnite and F(P) ={Ø} ∪F×(P). By Corollary 175I, F(P)\nandF×(P) are equinumerous. But\nF×(P)⊂F(M∪P)\\F(M)⊂F(M∪P);\ntherefore F(M∪P)\\F(M) andF×(P) are equinumerous (Theorem 175A). But Mand\nF(M) are equinumerous ( His the graph of a bijection from MtoF(M)). We conclude\nthatPandF(M∪P)\\F(M) are equinumerous, and we may choose a bijection ψ:P→\nF(M∪P)\\F(M). But then H∪Grψis the graph of a bijection from M∪PtoF(M∪P),\nhence a member of Gthat properly includes H, contradicting the maximality of H.\nOur supposition that Mdoes not outnumber S\\Mis thus untenable.\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 299\n175.

The\nassertion that this can always be done is the Well-Ordering Principle, a nd this was\nshown to be equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. In current mathemat ical practice, the\nuse of the Well-Ordering Principle has largely been superseded by the more practical\nuse of maximality principles; it retains its usefulness, however, in spe cial ﬁelds of\nmathematics (e.g., general topology), and also in its own set-theor etical context.\nWe begin by obtaining a result (Theorem 176C), of interest in its own r ight, which\nsays that well-ordered sets can be compared very precisely as to t heir “length”.\nWe recall from Section 81 that, if Dis an ordered set and x∈Dis given, we\ndenote by Spr( x) the set of all members of Dthat strictly precede x; this is also the\nset of strict lower bounds of {x}.\nLet the well-ordered sets DandD/primebe given. A mapping f:D→D/primeis called a\nmatching from DtoD/primeif it satisﬁes\n(176.1) f>(Spr(x)) = Spr/prime(f(x)) for all x∈D.\n(We use “primed” symbols for the ordered set D/prime.)\n176A. R EMARKS . (a): The deﬁnition of matching would be meaningful for any\nordered sets DandD/prime, but we shall use it only for well-ordered sets.\n(b): Every matching is strictly isotone, and hence injective. A mapp ingf:D→\nD/primeis an order-isomorphism if (and only if) it is both a matching and a surje ction\n(Proposition 62D).\n(c): For every well-ordered set Dand everyx∈D, the inclusion mapping 1 Spr(x)⊂D\nis a matching from the (well-)ordered subset Spr( x) ofDtoD.\n(d): A composite of matchings is a matching.\n176B. L EMMA .Let the well-ordered sets DandD/primebe given. If f:D→D/primeis a\nmatching but not an order-isomorphism, then there is exactl y onex/prime∈D/primesuch that\nf|Rngis an order-isomorphism from DtoSpr/prime(x/prime).\nProof . By Remark 176A,(b), fis not surjective. For every y/prime∈Rngfwe have\nSpr/prime(y/prime)⊂Rngf, on account of (176.1). By Lemma 82F, there is exactly one x/prime∈D/prime\nsuch that Rng f= Spr/prime(x/prime). Sincefis strictly isotone and Dis totally ordered,\nf|Rng:D→Spr/prime(x/prime) is an order-isomorphism.\n176C. T HEOREM .Let the well-ordered sets DandD/primebe given. Then there exists\na matching from DtoD/primeor a matching from D/primetoD, and there is at most one\nmatching of each kind. If there is a matching from DtoD/primeand also a matching from\nD/primetoD, then each is the inverse of the other, and they are order-iso morphisms.\nProof . 1. We ﬁrst prove the uniqueness assertion. Let the matchings fandg\nfromDtoD/primebe given. Let x∈Dbe given and assume that f|Spr(x)=g|Spr(x). Then\nSpr/prime(f(x)) =f>(Spr(x)) =g>(Spr(x)) = Spr/prime(g(x)). SinceD/primeis totally ordered, this\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 301\n176. Well-ordered sets 291\nimpliesf(x) =g(x). Sincex∈Dwas arbitrary, we have proved by induction that\nf(x) =g(x) for allx∈D, so thatf=g. This shows that there is at most one\nmatching from DtoD/prime. Repeating the argument with DandD/primeinterchanged, we\nconclude that there is at most one matching from D/primetoD.\nAssume that f:D→D/primeandf/prime:D/prime→Dare matchings. By Remark 176A,(d),\nf/prime◦fis a matching from DtoD, but so is 1 D. Since there is at most one matching\nfromDtoD(by the argument of the preceding paragraph), we must have f/prime◦f= 1D.\nIn a similar manner we conclude that f◦f/prime= 1D/prime. We have shown that each of fand\nf/primeis the inverse of the other. Since they are isotone, they are order -isomorphisms.\n2. It remains to prove the existence assertion. We use a method of recursive\ndeﬁnition with possible “break-down” of the recursion rule. We apply Theorem 82E\nwithI:=D, A x:=D/primefor allx∈D, and\nUx:={u∈D/primeSpr(x)|Rngu/negationslash=D/prime} for allx∈D,\nφx(u) := min(D/prime\\Rngu) for all x∈Dandu∈Ux.\nBy the theorem just quoted we conclude that there exists a (uniqu e) subsetKofD\nand family a∈D/primeKsuch that\n(176.2)x∈K⇔(Spr(x)⊂Kanda>(Spr(x))/negationslash=D/prime) for all x∈D,\n(176.3) ax= min(D/prime\\a>(Spr(x))) for all x∈K.\nLetx∈Kbe given. For every y∈Spr(x) we have Spr( y)⊂Spr(x), and (176.2)\nand (176.3) yield y∈Kand Spr/prime(ay)⊂a>(Spr(y))⊂a>(Spr(x)). We apply Lemma\n82F,((i) ⇒(ii)), to the well-ordered set D/primeand the subset a>(Spr(x)); this subset is\nnotD/primein view of (176.2), and therefore a>(Spr(x)) = Spr/prime(min(D/prime\\a>(Spr(x)))).\nCombining this with (176.3) and noting that x∈Kwas arbitrary, we ﬁnd\n(176.4) Spr/prime(ax) =a>(Spr(x)) for all x∈K.\nTwo cases must now be distinguished. In the ﬁrst case, K=D, and (176.4) shows\nthat the mapping ( x/mapsto→ax) :D→D/primeis a matching from DtoD/prime. In the second\ncase,K/negationslash=D; we now examine this case. From (176.2) and Lemma 82F we have\nK= Spr(k) for some (unique) k∈D. Sincek /∈Kbut Spr(k) =K, it follows from\n(176.2) that Rng a=a>(Spr(k)) =D/prime. Since (176.4) shows that ais strictly isotone,\nhence injective, the mapping ( x/mapsto→ax) :K→D/primeis bijective. If f/prime:D/prime→Kis its\ninverse, we have by (176.4),\nf/prime\n>(Spr/prime(x/prime)) = Spr(f/prime(x/prime)) for all x/prime∈D/prime.\nTherefore the mapping f/prime|Dis a matching from D/primetoD.\n176D. C OROLLARY .Let the well-ordered sets DandD/primebe given. Then exactly\none of the following three statements holds:\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 302\n292 CHAPTER 17.

The assertion follows from Theorem 176C with the help of Lemma 176 B\nand Remark 176A,(b).\nThe next theorem shows that there are many “diﬀerent” well-orde red sets. If we\nknew that every set can be well-ordered, this result would be an almo st immediate\nconsequence of Proposition 175B. Our purpose, however, is to us e the next theorem\nto derive the Well-Ordering Principle from assertion (XV).\n176E. T HEOREM (HARTOGS’S THEOREM ).For every collection of well-ordered sets\nthere exists a well-ordered set that is not order-isomorphi c to any member of the\ncollection.\nProof . 1. Since we shall have to deal with many well-ordered sets at once, we\nshall temporarily have to be especially precise. Thus let ( A;α) be a well-ordered\nset. For every x∈Awe indicate by Sprα(x) the set consisting of all members of\nAthat strictly precede xin the ordered set ( A;α); and for each x∈Awe use the\nabbreviation αx:=α|Sprα(x)for the appropriate restriction of the order α.\n2. Let the Λ 0be the given collection of well-ordered sets, and consider the collec-\ntion\nΛ := Λ 0∪ {(Sprα(x);αx)|(A;α)∈Λ0, x∈A}\nof well-ordered sets. It is clear that Λ satisﬁes the following conditio n:\n(176.5) (Sprα(x);αx)∈Λ for all ( A;α)∈Λ and allx∈A.\nWe deﬁne the relation σin Λ by the rule\n(176.6)∀(A;α),(B;β)∈Λ,(A;α)σ(B;β) :⇔(there is a matching from\n(A;α) to (B;β)).\nIt follows form (176.6) and Remark 176A,(d) that σis reﬂexive and transitive. From\nTheorem 176C it follows that σis total and that\n(176.7)∀(A;α),(B;β)∈Λ,((A;α)σ(B;β) and (B;β)σ(A;α))⇔\n⇔((A;α) and (B;β) are order-isomorphic) .\nLetPbe the partition of Λ associated with the equivalence relation “is orde r-isomorphic\nto” (Theorem 57C), and deﬁne the relation ≺inPby the rule\n∀Γ,∆∈ P,Γ≺∆ :⇔(∃(A;α)∈Γ,∃(B;β)∈∆,(A;α)σ(B;β)).\nIt follows from (176.7) and Proposition 57H that ≺is a total order in Pand that\n(176.8) ∀(A;α),(B;β)∈Λ,(A;α)σ(B;β)⇔ΩP((A;α))≺ΩP((B;β)).\nApril 17, 2014 14:24 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 303\n176. Well-ordered sets 293\n3. Let (A;α)∈Λ be given. It is clear from Remark 176A,(c), Theorem 176C, and\n(176.5) that\n(176.9) ∀x∈A, (Sprα(x);αx)σ(A;α)\n(176.10) ∀x,y∈A, x α y ⇔(Sprα(x);αx)σ(Sprα(y);αy).\n(Note that if xα\n/negationslash=ythenx∈Sprα(y) and Sprα(x) = Sprαy(x).)\nOn account of (176.8) and (176.9) we may deﬁne the mapping Ψ α:A→\nSpr≺(ΩP((A;α))) by the rule\nΨα(x) := ΩP((Sprα(x);αx)) for all x∈A.\nBy (176.8) and (176.10) it follows that Ψ αis strictlyα-≺-isotone. We shall now show\nthat Ψ αis surjective.\nLet Γ ∈Spr≺(ΩP((A;α))) be given, and choose ( B;β)∈Γ. Then ΩP((B;β)) =\nΓ/precedenotslnteqlΩP((A;α)). By (176.8) we ﬁnd that ( B;β)σ(A;α), so that there is a matching\nfrom (B;β) to (A;α) but (B;β) and (A;α) are not order-isomorphic. By Lemma 176B\nthere is exactly one b∈Asuch that (B;β) is order-isomorphic to (Sprα(b);αb). Then\nΓ = ΩP((B;β)) = ΩP((Sprα(b);αb)) = Ψ α(b)∈RngΨ α. Since Γ ∈Spr≺(ΩP((A;α)))\nwas arbitrary, we conclude that Ψ αis surjective. Since it is strictly isotone from the\nwell-ordered set ( A;α) to Spr≺(ΩP((A;α))) ordered by ≺, it is an order-isomorphism;\nand consequently Spr≺(ΩP((A;α))) is well-ordered by ≺.\nSince (A;α)∈Λ was arbitrary and Ω P: Λ→ P is surjective, we conclude that\nSpr≺(Γ) is well-ordered by ≺for every Γ ∈ P. A simple argument, which we omit,\nthen shows that Pitself is well-ordered by ≺.\n4. For every ( A;α)∈Λ we have just shown that there is an order-isomorphism\n(namely Ψ α) from (A;α) to Spr≺(ΩP((A;α))) ordered by ≺. By Corollary 176D we\ninfer that (A;α) is not order-isomorphic to ( P;≺). Thus ( P;≺) is a well-ordered set\nthat is not order-isomorphic to any member of Λ, let alone to any mem ber of the\ngiven collection Λ 0.\n176F. C OROLLARY .For every set Sthere exists a well-ordered set (W;ω)such\nthat no mapping from StoWis surjective.\nProof . Let theSbe given. Consider the collection Λ of all well-ordered sets whose\nunderlying sets are partitions of S(If Ord(A) denotes the set of all orders in the\nsetA, and Part( S) denotes the set of all partitions of S, then Λ may be regarded\nas a subset of˙/uniondisplay\nP∈Part( S)Ord(P).) By theorem 176E we may choose a well-ordered set\n(W;ω) that is not order-isomorphic to any member of Λ.\nNow letf:S→Wbe given, and suppose that fwere surjective. By Corollary\n36D, there would be a bijection from the partition Part fofSto the setW. Conse-\nquently there would be an order πin Partfsuch that the ordered set (Part f;π) is\norder-isomorphic to ( W;ω), and hence is well-ordered. But then (Part f;π)∈Λ, and\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 304\n294 CHAPTER 17. INFINITE SETS\nthis would contradict the choice of ( W;ω). Hence the supposition that fis surjective\nis untenable.\nWe are now ready to formulate the Well-Ordering Principle and to deriv e it from\nassertion (XV).\n(XVI) (W ELL-ORDERING PRINCIPLE ).Every set can be well-ordered; more precisely,\nfor every set Sthere exists an order ≺inSsuch that (S;≺)is well-ordered.\n176G. L EMMA .IfDis a well-ordered set, then (A/mapsto→minA) :P×(D)→Dis a\nchoice-mapping for the set D.\n176H. P ROPOSITION . (XV) implies (XVI), and(XVI) implies (XI).\nProof . (XV) implies (XVI). Let the set Sbe given. By Corollary 176F we may\nchoose a well-ordered set ( W;ω) such that there is no surjection from StoW. If (XV)\nholds, we may then choose a surjection from WtoS. Since there is a choice mapping\nforWby Lemma 176G, we may apply Lemma 174A and infer that we may choos e a\nright-inverse f:S→Wof this surjection; and fis injective. We may therefore deﬁne\nan order ≺inSin such a way that the bijection f|Rngis an order-isomorphism from\nSordered by ≺to Rngfordered by ω. Since the latter ordered set is well-ordered,\nso is the former.\n(XVI) implies (XI). this is an immediate consequence of Lemma 176G.\n176I. R EMARK . The set Nis well-ordered by ≤. It follows that every countable\nset can be well-ordered, and this assertion is valid regardless of the status of the\nWell-Ordering Principle (XVI).\n\nMarch 12, 2014 14:50 World Scienti\fc Book - 9.75in x 6.5in reduction page 305\n177.

L EMMA .LetDbe a collection of sets such that every nest Nincluded in\nDsatisﬁes/uniondisplay\nN ∈ D . Let Φ :D → D be a mapping such that, for every S∈ D, we\nhaveS⊂Φ(S)andΦ(S)\\Sis empty or a singleton. Then there exists S∈ D such\nthatΦ(S) =S.\nProof . 1. We require a deﬁnition. A subcollection TofDis called a tower if it\nsatisﬁes the following conditions:\n(177.1) every nest Nincluded in Tsatisﬁes/uniondisplay\nN ∈ T,\n(177.2) Φ>(T)⊂ T.\nWe observe that Dis itself a tower. It follows form this and the deﬁnition that the\ncollection of all towers is intersection-stable. Let Sbe the intersection of the whole\ncollection, i.e., the smallest of all towers. We intend to show that Sis in fact a nest.\n2. Set C:={S∈ S |T⊂SorS⊂Tfor allT∈ S} ; and for every S∈ Cset\nB(S) :={T∈ S |T⊂Sor Φ(S)⊂T}.\nLetS∈ Cbe given. We claim that B(S) is a tower. If Nis a nest and N ⊂ B (S),\nthen either T⊂Sfor allT∈ N, and then/uniondisplay\nN ⊂S, or there is T∈ N such that\nΦ(S)⊂T, and hence Φ( S)⊂/uniondisplay\nN. Thus in either case/uniondisplay\nN ∈ B (S), and we have\nshown that (177.1) holds for T:=B(S). LetT∈ B(S) be given; since S∈ C, we\nhave either Φ( T)⊂SorS/subsetornotdbleqlΦ(T). In the former case, Φ( T)∈ B(S). In the latter\ncase, the fact that T∈ B(S) implies that either T⊂S/subsetornotdbleqlΦ(T), which requires T=S\n(since Φ(T)\\Tis a singleton) and hence Φ( T) = Φ(S); or else Φ( S)⊂T⊂Φ(T); so\nthat Φ(T)∈ B(S) in this case as well. Since T∈ B(S) was arbitrary, (177.2) also\nholds for T:=B(S). We have shown that B(S) is a tower, as claimed; but B(S)⊂ S,\nand hence B(S) =S. This conclusion is valid for all S∈ C.\nWe next claim that Cis a tower. (177.1) holds for T:=C, by an argument quite\nsimilar to that of the preceding paragraph. If S∈ C andT∈ S =B(S), we have\neitherT⊂S⊂Φ(S) or Φ(S)⊂T, so that Φ( S)∈ C. Thus (177.2) also holds for\nT:=C, andCis a tower, as claimed. But C ⊂ S , and hence C=S. It follows from\nthe deﬁnition of CthatC=Sis a nest.\n3. Since Sis both a nest and a tower, we have/uniondisplay\nS ∈ S by (177.1). From (177.2)\nwe obtain Φ(/uniondisplay\nS)∈ S and therefore/uniondisplay\nS ⊂ Φ(/uniondisplay\nS)⊂/uniondisplay\nS, so that equality must\nhold. Thus S:=/uniondisplay\nS ∈ D satisﬁes Φ(S) =S.\n177B.
